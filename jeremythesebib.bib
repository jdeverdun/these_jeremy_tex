It is a consensus of the ISMRM Perfusion Study Group and the European ASL in Dementia consortium, both of whom met to reach this consensus in October 2012 in Amsterdam. Although ASL continues to undergo rapid technical development, we believe that current ASL methods are robust and ready to provide useful clinical information, and that a consensus statement on recommended implementations will help the clinical community to adopt a standardized approach. In this review, we describe the major considerations and trade-offs in implementing an ASL protocol and provide specific recommendations for a standard approach. Our conclusion is that as an optimal default implementation, we recommend pseudo-continuous labeling, background suppression, a segmented three-dimensional readout without vascular crushing gradients, and calculation and presentation of both label/control difference images and cerebral blood flow in absolute units using a simplified model.

The robustness and accuracy of our technique are evaluated on a vascular phantom scanned in different orientations. The reconstructed surface is compared to a surface generated by marching cubes followed by decimation and smoothing. Experiments show that the proposed technique reaches a good balance in terms of smoothness, number of triangles, and distance error.

abstract = {Blood flow in the circle of Willis (CoW) is modelled using the 1-D equations of pressure and flow wave propagation in compliant vessels. The model starts at the left ventricle and includes the largest arteries that supply the CoW. Based on published physiological data, it is able to capture the main features of pulse wave propagation along the aorta, at the brachiocephalic bifurcation and throughout the cerebral arteries. The collateral ability of the complete CoW and its most frequent anatomical variations is studied in normal conditions and after occlusion of a carotid or vertebral artery (VA). Our results suggest that the system does not require collateral pathways through the communicating arteries to adequately perfuse the brain of normal subjects. The communicating arteries become important in cases of missing or occluded vessels, the anterior communicating artery (ACoA) being a more critical collateral pathway than the posterior communicating arteries (PCoAs) if an internal carotid artery (ICA) is occluded. Occlusions of the VAs proved to be far less critical than occlusions of the ICAs. The worst scenario in terms of reduction in the mean cerebral outflows is a CoW without the first segment of an anterior cerebral artery combined with an occlusion of the contralateral ICA. Furthermore, in patients without any severe occlusion of a carotid or VA, the direction of flow measured at the communicating arteries corresponds to the side of the CoW with an absent or occluded artery. Finally, we study the effect of partial occlusions of the communicating arteries on the cerebral flows, which again confirms that the ACoA is a more important collateral pathway than the PCoAs if an ICA is occluded. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Blood supply through collateral pathways improves regional cerebral blood flow and may protect against ischemic events. The effect of collaterals on the risk of stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA), in the presence of angiographic severe internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis, was assessed. METHODS: Angiographic collateral filling through anterior communicating and posterior communicating arteries and retrograde filling through ophthalmic arteries were determined in all patients at entry into the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial. Kaplan-Meier event-free survival analyses were performed on 339 medically treated and 342 surgically treated patients. RESULTS: The presence of collaterals supplying the symptomatic ICA increased with severity of stenosis. Two-year risk of hemispheric stroke in medically treated patients with severe ICA stenosis was reduced in the presence of collaterals: 27.8\% to 11.3\% (P=0.005). Similar reductions were observed for hemispheric TIA (36.1\% versus 19.1\%; P=0.008) and disabling or fatal strokes (13.3\% versus 6.3\%; P=0.11). For surgically treated patients, the perioperative risk of hemispheric stroke was 1.1\% in the presence of collaterals versus 4. 9\% when absent. The 2-year stroke risks for surgical patients with and without collaterals were 5.9\% versus 8.4\%, respectively. Neither comparison in the surgical group was statistically significant. The observed reductions were independent of the degree of ICA stenosis and other vascular risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Collaterals are associated with a lower risk of hemispheric stroke and TIA, both long term and perioperatively. Angiographic identification of collaterals assists in identifying patients with severe ICA stenosis at lower risk of stroke and TIA.},

Inadequate data in this area can lead to severe underestimation of the spatial specificity of the BOLD response. We took thick sections of Indian ink injected human brain and, using confocal laser microscopy and a novel three-dimensional computer-assisted method we extracted and analyzed hundreds of thousands of vascular segments within a large area of cortex. From this database the global densities, the statistical distributions of diameters and lengths were analysed, separating the tree-like and the net-like parts of the microcirculation. Furthermore, our analysis included variations in volume density along the cortical depth and along vectors parallel to the cortical surface.

The resulting 3D images with a spatial resolution of less than the minimum capillary diameter permit a complete description of the entire vascular network for volumes as large as tens of cubic millimeters. The structural properties of the vascular networks were investigated by several multiscale methods such as fractal and power-spectrum analysis. These investigations gave a new coherent picture of normal and pathological complex vascular structures. They showed that normal cortical vascular networks have scale-invariant fractal properties on a small scale from 1.4 mum up to 40 to 65 mum. Above this threshold, vascular networks can be considered as homogeneous. Tumor vascular networks show similar characteristics, but the validity range of the fractal regime extend to much larger spatial dimensions. These 3D results shed new light on previous two dimensional analyses giving for the first time a direct measurement of vascular modules associated with vessel-tissue surface exchange.},

The cerebrovenous system represents a complex three-dimensional structure that is often asymmetric and considerably represent more variable pattern than the arterial anatomy. Particular emphasis is devoted to the venous return to extracranial drainage routes. As the state-of-the-art-imaging methods are playing a greater role in visualizing the intracranial venous system at present, its clinically pertinent anatomy and physiology has gain increasing interest, even so only few data are available. For this reason, experimental research on specific biophysical (fluid dynamic, rheologic factors) and hemodynamic (venous pressure, cerebral venous blood flow) parameters of the cerebral venous system is more on the focus; especially as these parameters are different to the cerebral arterial system. Particular emphasis is devoted to the venous return to extracranial drainage routes. From the present point of view, it seems that the cerebrovenous system may be one of the most important factors that guarantee normal brain function. In the light of this increasing interest in the cerebral venous system, the authors have summarized the current knowledge of the physiology of the cerebrovenous system and discuss it is in the light of its clinical relevance.},

abstract = {The anatomical variations of sylvian vein and cistern were investigated during the pterional approach in 750 operative cases with different pathologies. All patients were operated on at the Neurosurgical Department of Ataturk University Medical School, Erzurum, Turkiye. The patients underwent surgery for the lesions necessitating the right or left pterional approach. The findings were recorded during surgical intervention and observed through the operative sketches of the pathologies, the slides, and videotapes of the operations. In our study, we surgically classified the variations of sylvian vein, according to its branching and draining patterns. Type I: The fronto-orbital (frontosylvian), fronto-parietal (parietosylvian) and anterior temporal (temporosylvian) veins drain into one sylvian vein. Type II: Two superficial sylvian veins with separated basal vein draining into the sphenoparietal and Rosenthal's basal vein. Type III: Two superficial sylvian veins draining into the sphenoparietal and the superior petrosal veins. Type IV: Hypoplastic superficial sylvian vein and the deep one. Four types of sylvian vein variations were defined as follows. The type I was seen in 52.8\% (n = 396), the type II was found in 19.2\% (n = 144), type III was recorded in 18.2\% (n = 137), and type IV, or hypoplastic and deep form was discovered in 9.8\% (n = 73) of patients. The coursing of sylvian vein was in the temporal side (Temporal Coursing) in 62.4 percent of the cases (n = 469), in the frontal side (Frontal Coursing) in 25 \% of the patients (n = 187) and in 9 percent of the cases (n = 67) in the deep localization (Deep Coursing). Only 3.6\% of the cases (n = 27) showed Mixed Coursing. The variations of the sylvian cisterns were classified into three types, according to the relationships between the lateral fronto-orbital gyrus and the superior temporal gyrus. In Sylvian type, the frontal and temporal lobes are loosely (Sylvian Type A, wide and large) or tightly (Sylvian Type B, close and narrow) approximated on the surface thereby covering the substance of the sylvian cistern. In Frontal Type, the proximal part of the lateral fronto-orbital gyrus herniated into the temporal lobe. In Temporal Type, the proximal part of the superior temporal gyrus herniated into the lateral fronto-orbital gyrus. The variations of the sylvian cisterns in 750 patients with different pathologies, were as follows: in 47.7\% (n = 358) Sylvian type A, in 27.2\% percent (n = 204) Sylvian type B, in 16.3\% (n = 122) frontal type and in 8.8\% (n = 66) temporal type. We concluded that venous perfusion discorder of the brain is the most important factor during the pterional approach. Careful intraoperative assessment and protection of the sylvian vein, which is a surgical pitfall, is an indispensable part of the operation. The recognition of the anatomical variations of the sylvian vein and cistern, and the detailed knowledge of the microvascular relationships and the importance of preservation of this vein at that level, will allow the neurosurgeon, believing in the minimally invasive neurosurgical techniques, to construct a better and safer microdissection plan, to save time, and can prevent postoperative neurological deficits.},

abstract = {The sparsity which is implicit in MR images is exploited to significantly undersample k-space. Some MR images such as angiograms are already sparse in the pixel representation; other, more complicated images have a sparse representation in some transform domain-for example, in terms of spatial finite-differences or their wavelet coefficients. According to the recently developed mathematical theory of compressed-sensing, images with a sparse representation can be recovered from randomly undersampled k-space data, provided an appropriate nonlinear recovery scheme is used. Intuitively, artifacts due to random undersampling add as noise-like interference. In the sparse transform domain the significant coefficients stand out above the interference. A nonlinear thresholding scheme can recover the sparse coefficients, effectively recovering the image itself. In this article, practical incoherent undersampling schemes are developed and analyzed by means of their aliasing interference. Incoherence is introduced by pseudo-random variable-density undersampling of phase-encodes. The reconstruction is performed by minimizing the l(1) norm of a transformed image, subject to data fidelity constraints. Examples demonstrate improved spatial resolution and accelerated acquisition for multislice fast spin-echo brain imaging and 3D contrast enhanced angiography.},

abstractNote={In MRI, the main magnetic field polarizes the electron cloud of a molecule, generating a 
chemical shift for observer protons within the molecule and a magnetic susceptibility inhomogeneity field 
for observer protons outside the molecule. The number of water protons surrounding a molecule for 
detecting its magnetic susceptibility is vastly greater than the number of protons within the molecule 
for detecting its chemical shift. However, the study of tissue magnetic susceptibility has been hindered 
by poor molecular specificities of hitherto used methods based on MRI signal phase and T2* contrast, 
which depend convolutedly on surrounding susceptibility sources. Deconvolution of the MRI signal phase 
can determine tissue susceptibility but is challenged by the lack of MRI signal in the background and 
by the zeroes in the dipole kernel. Recently, physically meaningful regularizations, including the 
Bayesian approach, have been developed to enable accurate quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) 
for studying iron distribution, metabolic oxygen consumption, blood degradation, calcification, 
demyelination, and other pathophysiological susceptibility changes, as well as contrast agent 
biodistribution in MRI. This paper attempts to summarize the basic physical concepts and essential 
algorithmic steps in QSM, to describe clinical and technical issues under active development, and to

It briefly introduces the physical background of the underlying bulk magnetic susceptibility effects, on which this approach is based, and it demonstrates the successful application of the method for imaging different intracranial lesions, like venous anomalies, arteriovenous malformations and brain tumors. The susceptibility difference between venous blood and the surrounding tissue is used to generate contrast. Using this method it is possible to visualize draining veins in lesions better than conventional magnetic resonance imaging methods, which often require application of a contrast medium or even conventional catheter angiography. Limitations of the method are discussed. The ability to highlight deoxygenated blood with high spatial resolution yields important vascular parameters which may be helpful for improved modeling of MR signal changes during functional brain activation, it may lead to a better understanding of brain function in diseased states, or it may even offer the possibility of differentiating benign from malignant tumors non-invasively.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a method of choice for establishing the correct diagnosis in a great majority of neurologic disorders, especially in detection the causes of seizures and both acute and slowly progressive neurologic disturbances, computerized tomography is becoming more frequently excluded from obligate spectrum of diagnostic protocol. METHODS: MRI was performed on 1.5 T MR scanner in two patients, in one suffering from pseudohypoparathyroidism, and in another with Fahr disease, while CT was initially excluded from the diagnostic protocol. In third patient, 11-year-old boy with hypercalcemia, both CT and MRI were indicated because of seizure attack. RESULTS: Completely normal appearing brain parenchyma was seen on T2W images in a patient with clinical diagnosis of pseudohypoparathyroidism while extensive intracerebral calcifications were noted after additionally performed computerized tomography of the brain. In another patient with Fahr disease and neurologic symptoms, extensive calcifications were evident on CT, while MR examination had revealed bilateral symmetric lesions of prolonged T2W signal in the basal ganglia, supratentorial white matter and cerebellum, most compatible toxic/metabolic demyelination. In the third patient, a boy with hypercalcemia, marked left parietal cortical calcification was noted on CT, while MRI, including T2 gradient-echo sequence was inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS: MRI, without CT, can be not only confusing, but even misleading diagnostic modality for detection of not only subtle, but also extensive cerebral calcifications. The benefit of gradient-echo T2 sequence, that is usually included in MR protocol when intracranial calcifications are suspected, is also rather limited.},

QSM with ℓ1 and ℓ2 regularization are compared in numerical simulations of vessel structures with known magnetic susceptibility.

SvO2 values in major cerebral veins lie within the normal physiological range reported by (15) O positron emission tomography. SvO2 from QSM is consistent with previous MR susceptometry methods for vessel segments oriented parallel to the main magnetic field. In vessel simulations, ℓ1 regularization results in less than 10\% SvO2 absolute error across all vessel tilt orientations and provides more accurate SvO2 estimation than ℓ2 regularization.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The proposed analysis of susceptibility images enables reliable mapping of quantitative SvO2 along venograms and may facilitate clinical use of venous oxygenation imaging.},

abstract = {For the last century, there has been great physiological interest in brain iron and its role in brain function and disease. It is well known that iron accumulates in the brain for people with Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, chronic hemorrhage, cerebral infarction, anemia, thalassemia, hemochromatosis, Hallervorden-Spatz, Down syndrome, AIDS and in the eye for people with macular degeneration. Measuring the amount of nonheme iron in the body may well lead to not only a better understanding of the disease progression but an ability to predict outcome. As there are many forms of iron in the brain, separating them and quantifying each type have been a major challenge. In this review, we present our understanding of attempts to measure brain iron and the potential of doing so with magnetic resonance imaging. Specifically, we examine the response of the magnetic resonance visible iron in tissue that produces signal changes in both magnitude and phase images. These images seem to correlate with brain iron content, perhaps ferritin specifically, but still have not been successfully exploited to accurately and precisely quantify brain iron. For future quantitative studies of iron content we propose four methods: correlating R2' and phase to iron content; applying a special filter to the phase to obtain a susceptibility map; using complex analysis to extract the product of susceptibility and volume content of the susceptibility source; and using early and late echo information to separately predict susceptibility and volume content.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To enable fast reconstruction of quantitative susceptibility maps with total variation penalty and automatic regularization parameter selection.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: ℓ1 -Regularized susceptibility mapping is accelerated by variable splitting, which allows closed-form evaluation of each iteration of the algorithm by soft thresholding and fast Fourier transforms. This fast algorithm also renders automatic regularization parameter estimation practical. A weighting mask derived from the magnitude signal can be incorporated to allow edge-aware regularization.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Compared with the nonlinear conjugate gradient (CG) solver, the proposed method is 20 times faster. A complete pipeline including Laplacian phase unwrapping, background phase removal with SHARP filtering, and ℓ1 -regularized dipole inversion at 0.6 mm isotropic resolution is completed in 1.2 min using MATLAB on a standard workstation compared with 22 min using the CG solver. This fast reconstruction allows estimation of regularization parameters with the L-curve method in 13 min, which would have taken 4 h with the CG algorithm. The proposed method also permits magnitude-weighted regularization, which prevents smoothing across edges identified on the magnitude signal. This more complicated optimization problem is solved 5 times faster than the nonlinear CG approach. Utility of the proposed method is also demonstrated in functional blood oxygen level-dependent susceptibility mapping, where processing of the massive time series dataset would otherwise be prohibitive with the CG solver.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Online reconstruction of regularized susceptibility maps may become feasible with the proposed dipole inversion.

abstract = {Quantitative magnetic susceptibility mapping (QSM) has recently been introduced to provide a novel quantitative and local MRI contrast. However, the anatomical contrast represented by in vivo susceptibility maps has not yet been compared systematically and comprehensively with gradient (recalled) echo (GRE) magnitude, frequency, and R2
* images. Therefore, this study compares high-resolution quantitative susceptibility maps with conventional GRE imaging approaches (magnitude, frequency, R2
*) in healthy individuals at 7T with respect to anatomic tissue contrast. Volumes-of-interest were analyzed in deep and cortical gray matter (GM) as well as in white matter (WM) on R2
* and susceptibility maps. High-resolution magnetic susceptibility maps of the human brain exhibited superb contrast that allowed the identification of substructures of the thalamus, midbrain and basal ganglia, as well as of the cerebral cortex. These were consistent with histology but not generally visible on magnitude, frequency or R2
*-maps. Common target structures for deep brain stimulation, including substantia nigra pars reticulata, ventral intermediate nucleus, subthalamic nucleus, and the substructure of the internal globus pallidus, were clearly distinguishable from surrounding tissue on magnetic susceptibility maps. The laminar substructure of the cortical GM differed depending on the anatomical region, i.e., a cortical layer with increased magnetic susceptibility, corresponding to the Stria of Gennari, was found in the GM of the primary visual cortex, V1, whereas a layer with reduced magnetic susceptibility was observed in the GM of the temporal cortex. Both magnetic susceptibility and R2
* values differed substantially in cortical GM depending on the anatomic regions. Regression analysis between magnetic susceptibility and R2
* values of WM and GM structures suggested that variations in myelin content cause the overall contrast between gray and white matter on susceptibility maps and that both R2
* and susceptibility values provide linear measures for iron content in GM. In conclusion, quantitative magnetic susceptibility mapping provides a non-invasive and spatially specific contrast that opens the door to the assessment of diseases characterized by variation in iron and/or myelin concentrations. Its ability to reflect anatomy of deep GM structures with superb delineation may be useful for neurosurgical applications. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Given the size and complexity of modern angiographic acquisitions, segmentation is a key step toward the accurate visualization, diagnosis and quantification of vascular pathologies. Despite the tremendous amount of past and on-going dedicated research, vascular segmentation remains a challenging task. In this paper, we review state-of-the-art literature on vascular segmentation, with a particular focus on 3D contrast-enhanced imaging modalities (MRA and CTA). We structure our analysis along three axes: models, features and extraction schemes. We first detail model-based assumptions on the vessel appearance and geometry which can embedded in a segmentation approach. We then review the image features that can be extracted to evaluate these models. Finally, we discuss how existing extraction schemes combine model and feature information to perform the segmentation task. Each component (model, feature and extraction scheme) plays a crucial role toward the efficient, robust and accurate segmentation of vessels of interest. Along each axis of study, we discuss the theoretical and practical properties of recent approaches and highlight the most advanced and promising ones. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The segmentation of the human airway tree from volumetric computed tomography (CT) images builds an important step for many clinical applications and for physiological studies. Previously proposed algorithms suffer from one or several problems: leaking into the surrounding lung parenchyma, the need for the user to manually adjust parameters, excessive runtime. Low-dose CT scans are increasingly utilized in lung screening studies, but segmenting them with traditional airway segmentation algorithms often yields less than satisfying results. In this paper, a new airway segmentation method based on fuzzy connectivity is presented. Small adaptive regions of interest are used that follow the airway branches as they are segmented. This has several advantages. It makes it possible to detect leaks early and avoid them, the segmentation algorithm can automatically adapt to changing image parameters, and the computing time is kept within moderate values. The new method is robust in the sense that it works on various types of scans (low-dose and regular dose, normal subjects and diseased subjects) without the need for the user to manually adjust any parameters. Comparison with a commonly used region-grow segmentation algorithm shows that the newly proposed method retrieves a significantly higher count of airway branches. A method that conducts accurate cross-sectional airway measurements on airways is presented as an additional processing step. Measurements are conducted in the original gray-level volume. Validation on a phantom shows that subvoxel accuracy is achieved for all airway sizes and airway orientations.},

independent of the local width. The filter is steerable in both the

Monte Carlo experiments using simulated and clinical data are used to quantify how these "dynamic-scale" enhancements address clinical needs regarding speed, accuracy, and automation. In particular, we show that dynamic-scale ridge traversal is insensitive to its initial parameter settings, operates with little additional computational overhead, tracks centerlines with subvoxel accuracy, passes branch points, and handles significant image noise.

The system of differential equations of first principles conservation balances is discretized and solved numerically. Fluid-solid interactions of the brain parenchyma with cerebral blood and CSF are calculated. The model provides the transitions from normal dynamics to the diseased state during the onset of communicating hydrocephalus.

abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate vessel density changes with increasing age in three areas of the brain and to correlate these changes with leukoaraiosis (LA) on the basis of magnetic resonance (MR) images and location in deep white matter (WM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Internal review board approval or informed consent from next of kin was not required. Brains of 21 subjects (mean age, 72.5 years; 12 men, nine women) were evaluated at autopsy with MR imaging. The presence of LA was indicated by confluent or patchy areas of hyperintensity in deep WM. Microvascular density (percentage of vessel area divided by total area) in subjects with LA was measured with computerized morphometric analysis in LA lesions, healthy-appearing WM at MR imaging, and the cortex. These measurements were compared with each other and with measurements from corresponding areas in healthy subjects. Afferent vasculature was stained with alkaline phosphatase in celloidin sections. Hypotheses were tested with computation of a series of repeated-measures linear mixed models. RESULTS: Autopsy brains from 12 subjects with LA (mean age, 72 years; six men, six women) and nine subjects without LA (mean age, 73 years; six men, three women) were studied. Afferent microvascular density +/- standard deviation in LA lesions in deep WM (2.56\% +/- 1.56) was significantly lower than that in corresponding deep WM of healthy subjects (3.20\% +/- 1.82) (P = .018). Subjects with LA demonstrated decreased afferent vascular density at early ages in all three areas of the brain when compared with healthy subjects of the same age. CONCLUSION: Findings of decreased afferent vascular density in the area of LA and outside the lesion indicate that LA is a generalized cerebrovascular disease process rather than one confined to deep WM.},

abstract = {Although a wide range of approaches have been developed to automatically assess the volume of brain regions from MRI, the reproducibility of these algorithms across different scanners and pulse sequences, their accuracy in different clinical populations and sensitivity to real changes in brain volume have not always been comprehensively examined. Firstly we present a comprehensive testing protocol which comprises 312 freely available MR images to assess the accuracy, reproducibility and sensitivity of automated brain segmentation techniques. Accuracy is assessed in infants, young adults and patients with Alzheimer's disease in comparison to gold standard measures by expert observers using a manual technique based on Cavalieri's principle. The protocol determines the reliability of segmentation between scanning sessions, different MRI pulse sequences and 1.5. T and 3. T field strengths and examines their sensitivity to small changes in volume using a large longitudinal dataset. Secondly we apply this testing protocol to a novel algorithm for segmenting the lateral ventricles and compare its performance to the widely used FSL FIRST and FreeSurfer methods. The testing protocol produced quantitative measures of accuracy, reliability and sensitivity of lateral ventricle volume estimates for each segmentation method. The novel algorithm showed high accuracy in all populations (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC > 0.95), good reproducibility between MRI pulse sequences (ICC > 0.99) and was sensitive to age related changes in longitudinal data. FreeSurfer demonstrated high accuracy (ICC > 0.95), good reproducibility (ICC > 0.99) and sensitivity whilst FSL FIRST showed good accuracy in young adults and infants (ICC > 0.90) and good reproducibility (ICC = 0.98), but was unable to segment ventricular volume in patients with Alzheimer's disease or healthy subjects with large ventricles. Using the same computer system, the novel algorithm and FSL FIRST processed a single MRI image in less than 10. min while FreeSurfer took approximately 7. h. The testing protocol presented enables the accuracy, reproducibility and sensitivity of different algorithms to be compared. We also demonstrate that the novel segmentation algorithm and FreeSurfer are both effective in determining lateral ventricular volume and are well suited for multicentre and longitudinal MRI studies. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Automatic segmentation of the human brain ventricular system from MR images is useful in studies of brain anatomy and its diseases. Existing intensity-based segmentation methods are adaptive to large shape and size variations of the ventricular system, but may leak to the non-ventricular regions due to the non-homogeneity, noise and partial volume effect in the images. Deformable model-based methods are more robust to noise and alleviate the leakage problem, but may generate wrong results when the shape or size of the ventricle to be segmented in the images has a large difference in comparison to its model. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-based region growing and trimming approach where: (1) a model of a ventricular system is used to define regions of interest (ROI) for the four ventricles (i.e., left, right, third and fourth); (2) to segment a ventricle in its ROI, a region growing procedure is first applied to obtain a connected region that contains the ventricle, and (3) a region trimming procedure is then employed to trim the non-ventricle regions. A hysteretic thresholding is developed for the region growing procedure to cope with the partial volume effect and minimize non-ventricular regions. The domain knowledge on the shape and intensity features of the ventricular system is used for the region trimming procedure. Due to the joint use of the model-based and intensity-based approaches, our method is robust to noise and large shape and size variations. Experiments on 18 simulated and 58 clinical MR images show that the proposed approach is able to segment the ventricular system accurately with the dice similarity coefficient ranging from 91\% to 99\%.},

The algorithm is based upon region-growing and mathematical morphology operators and starts from a coarse binary total brain segmentation, which is obtained from the 3-D-FFE image. Anatomical knowledge of the ventricular system has been incorporated into the method in order to find all constituting parts of the system, even if they are disconnected, and to avoid inclusion of nonventricle cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) regions. A test of the method on a synthetic MR brain image produced a segmentation overlap of 0.98 between the simulated ventricles ("model") and those defined by the algorithm. Further tests were performed on a large data set of 227 1.5 T MR brain images. The algorithm yielded useful results for 98\% of the images. The automatic segmentations had intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.996 for the lateral ventricles and 0.86 for the third ventricle, with manually edited segmentations. Comparison of ventricular volumes of schizophrenia patients compared with those of healthy control subjects showed results in agreement with the literature.},

abstract = {Measures of brain activation (e.g., changes in scalp electrical potentials) have become the most popular method for inferring brain function. However, examining brain disruption (e.g., examining behavior after brain injury) can complement activation studies. Activation techniques identify regions involved with a task, whereas disruption techniques are able to discover which regions are crucial for a task. Voxel-based lesion mapping can be used to determine relationships between behavioral measures and the location of brain injury, revealing the function of brain regions. Lesion mapping can also correlate the effectiveness of neurosurgery with the location of brain resection, identifying optimal surgical targets. Traditionally, voxel-based lesion mapping has employed the chi-square test when the clinical measure is binomial and the Student's t test when measures are continuous. Here we suggest that the Liebermeister approach for binomial data is more sensitive than the chi-square test. We also suggest that a test described by Brunner and Munzel is more appropriate than the t test for nonbinomial data because clinical and neuropsychological data often violate the assumptions of the t test. We test our hypotheses comparing statistical tests using both simulated data and data obtained from a sample of stroke patients with disturbed spatial perception. We also developed software to implement these tests (MRIcron), made freely available to the scientific community.},

Our objective was to investigate the association of hypertension with global and regional cerebral vasoreactivity to CO(2) using continuous arterial spin labeling MRI, independent of stroke and white matter hyperintensities. Participants (n=62; mean age: 66.7±1.0 years, 55\% women, 84\% white, 65\% hypertension, 47\% stroke) underwent arterial spin labeling perfusion MRI during normal breathing, 5\% CO(2) rebreathing, and hyperventilation, as well as 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Vasoreactivity was the slope of the regression between cerebral perfusion and end-tidal CO(2). White matter hyperintensity volumes were quantified. Nighttime dipping was calculated as the percentage decline in nighttime/daytime blood pressure. After accounting for stroke and white matter hyperintensity volume, hypertensive participants had lower global vasoreactivity (1.11±0.13 versus 0.43±0.1 mL/100 g per minute per millimeter of mercury; P=0.0012). Regionally, this was significant in the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes. Higher mean systolic blood pressure was associated with lower vasoreactivity (decreased by 0.11 U/10-mm Hg increase in systolic blood pressure; P=0.04), but nighttime dipping was not (P=0.2). The magnitude of decrease in vasoreactivity in hypertension without stroke was comparable to the magnitude of decrease in vasoreactivity in stroke without hypertension. Hypertension has a direct negative effect on the cerebrovascular circulation independent of white matter hyperintensities and stroke that is comparable to that seen with stroke. Because lower vasoreactivity is associated with poor outcomes, studies of the impact of antihypertensive on vasoreactivity are important.},

abstract = {This presentation describes structural and functional properties of the cerebral circulation that are unique to the brain, an organ with high metabolic demands, and the need for tight water and ion homeostasis. Autoregulation is pronounced in the brain, with myogenic, metabolic, and neurogenic mechanisms contributing to maintain relatively constant blood flow during both increases and de- creases in pressure. In addition, unlike peripheral organs where the majority of vascular resistance resides in small arteries and arterioles, large extracranial and intracranial arteries contribute signifi- cantly to vascular resistance in the brain. The prominent role of large arteries in cerebrovascular resistance helps maintain blood flow and protect downstream vessels during changes in perfusion pressure. The cerebral endothelium is also unique in that its barrier properties are in some way more like epithelium than endothelium in the periphery. The cerebral endothelium, known as the blood–brain barrier, has specialized tight junctions that do not allow ions to pass freely and has very low hydraulic conductivity and transcellular transport. This special configuration modifies Starling’s forces in the brain such that ions retained in the vascular lumen oppose water movement due to hy- drostatic pressure. Tight water regulation is necessary in the brain because it has limited capacity for expansion within the skull. Increased intracranial pressure due to vasogenic edema can cause severe neurologic complications and death. This chapter will review these special features of the cerebral circulation and how they contribute to the physiology of the brain.},

@article{Lang2003,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that a moving correlation index between mean arterial blood pressure and intracranial pressure, called PRx, can be used to monitor and quantify cerebral vasomotor reactivity in patients with head injury. OBJECTIVES: To validate this index and study its relation with cerebral blood flow velocity and cerebral autoregulation; and to identify variables associated with impairment or preservation of cerebral vasomotor reactivity. METHODS: The PRx was validated in a prospective study of 40 head injured patients. A PRx value of less than 0.3 indicates intact cerebral vasomotor reactivity, and a value of more than 0.3, impaired reactivity. Arterial blood pressure, intracranial pressure, mean cerebral perfusion pressure, and cerebral blood flow velocity, measured bilaterally with transcranial Doppler ultrasound, were recorded. Dynamic cerebrovascular autoregulation was measured using a moving correlation coefficient between arterial blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity, the Mx, for each cerebral hemisphere. All variables were compared in patients with intact and impaired cerebral vasomotor reactivity. RESULTS: No correlation between arterial blood pressure or cerebral perfusion pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity was seen in 19 patients with intact cerebral vasomotor reactivity. In contrast, the correlation between these variables was significant in 21 patients with impaired cerebral vasomotor reactivity, whose cerebral autoregulation was reduced. There was no correlation with intracranial pressure, arterial blood pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, or interhemispheric cerebral autoregulation differences, but the values for these indices were largely within normal limits. CONCLUSIONS: The PRx is valid for monitoring and quantifying cerebral vasomotor reactivity in patients with head injury. This intracranial pressure based index reflects changes in cerebral blood flow and cerebral autoregulatory capacity, suggesting a close link between blood flow and intracranial pressure in head injured patients. This explains why increases in arterial blood pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure may be useful for reducing intracranial pressure in selected head injured patients (those with intact cerebral vasomotor reactivity).},

abstract = {Local cerebral blood flow is lowered in many brain areas of the rat by high-dose pentobarbital (50 mg/kg). In the present study, the mechanism of this flow change was examined by measuring the distribution of radiolabeled red blood cells (RBCs) and albumin (RISA) in small parenchymal microvessels and calculating the microvascular distribution spaces and mean transit times of RBCs, RISA, and blood. In most brain areas, pentobarbital slightly decreased the RISA space, modestly increased the RBC space, and did not alter the blood space. The mean transit times of RBCs, RISA, and blood through the perfused microvessels were considerably greater in treated rats than in controls. These findings indicate that the mechanism by which high-dose pentobarbital diminishes local cerebral blood flow in rat brain is, in the main, a lowered linear velocity of plasma and RBC flow through small parenchymal microvessels and not decreased percentage of perfused capillaries (capillary retirement). This response is probably driven mainly by lowered local metabolism and may well entail a slight increase in the number of small microvessels that are perfused by RBCs.},

Perfused capillaries were stained by labeling the plasma with the gamma globulin-coupled fluorochromes, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and lissamine-rhodamine B 200 (RB 200). The density of perfused capillaries was determined in 12 different brain structures by fluorescence microscopy of embedded brain sections following coronal sectioning in a cryostat. Significant differences were found among brain structures investigated; the lowest density of perfused capillaries was found in the white matter (e.g., corpus callosum 162 fragments/mm2), whereas the highest values were determined in the structures of the auditory system (e.g., inferior colliculus 810 fragments/mm2). LCBF and LCGU were measured in two separate groups of rats using standard autoradiographic methods. In all three experimental groups, the same structures were identified and measured with a high degree of accuracy and local resolution. Density of perfused capillaries correlated well with LCBF (r = 0.93) and even better with LCGU (r = 0.97). In addition to the relationship between LCGU and LCBF established by earlier studies, these data show the intimate interrelationship between LCGU, density of perfused capillaries, and LCBF.},

abstract = {Brain tissue movements were studied in axial, sagittal and coronal planes in 15 healthy volunteers, using a gated spin echo MRI sequence. All movements had characteristics different from those of perfusion and diffusion. The highest velocities occurred during systole in the basal ganglia (maximum 1.0 mm/s) and brain stem (maximum 1.5 mm/s). The movements were directed caudally, medially and posteriorly in the basal ganglia, and caudally-anteriorly in the pons. Caudad and anterior motion increased towards the foramen magnum and towards the midline. The resultant movement occurred in a funnel-shaped fashion as if the brain were pulled by the spinal cord. This may be explained by venting of brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through the tentorial notch and foramen magnum. The intracranial volume is assumed to be always constant by the Monro-Kellie doctrine. The intracranial dynamics can be viewed as an interplay between the spatial requirements of four main components: arterial blood, capillary blood (brain volume), venous blood and CSF. These components could be characterized, and the expansion of the arteries and the brain differentiated, by applying the Monro-Kellie doctrine to every moment of the cardiac cycle. The arterial expansion causes a re-moulding of the brain that enables its piston-like action. The arterial expansion creates the prerequisites for the expansion of the brain by venting CSF to the spinal canal. The expansion of the brain is, in turn, responsible for compression of the ventricular system and hence for the intraventricular flow of CSF.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent studies of the organization of the cerebral venous system in healthy subjects using phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) show its structural complexity and inter-individual variations. Our objective was to study the venous blood and CSF flows in cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMATERIALS AND METHODS: PC-MRI sequences were added to brain MRI conventional protocol in 19 patients suspected of CVT, among whom 6 patients had CVT diagnosis confirmed by MR venography. Results were compared with 18 healthy age-matched volunteers (HV).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In patients without CVT (NoCVT) confirmed by venography, we found heterogeneous individual venous flows, and variable side dominance in paired veins and sinuses, comparable to those in healthy volunteers. In CVT patients, PC-MRI detected no venous flow in the veins and/or sinuses with thrombosis. Arterial flows were preserved. CSF aqueductal and cervical stroke volumes were increased in a patient with secondary cerebral infarction, and decreased in 4 patients with extended thrombosis in the superior sagittal and transverse sinuses. These results suggest the main role of the venous system in the regulation of the dynamic intracranial equilibrium.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: CVT produces highly individualized pattern of disturbance in venous blood drainage. Complementary to MRI venography, PC-MRI provides non-invasive data about venous blockage consequences on CSF flow disturbances.},

abstract = {The brain tamponade represents the final condition of a progressive intracranial pressure (ICP) increase up to values close to arterial blood pressure (BP) producing a reverberating flow pattern in the cerebral arteries with no net flow. This finding implies intracranial volume changes, therefore a full application of the Monro-Kellie doctrine is impossible. To resolve this contradiction, in eight pigs a reversible condition of brain tamponade was produced by infusing saline into a cerebral ventricle. The following parameters were measured: BP in the common carotid artery, ICP by the same needle utilised for the infusion, arterial and venous blood flow velocity (BFV) at, respectively, internal carotid artery (ICA) and sagittal sinus (SS) site by ultrasound technique. When ICP approached carotid BP values, reverberating BFV waves both at ICA and SS site were simultaneously observed. The arterial and venous reverberating waves appeared to be almost exactly superimposable, with a delay of about 40 msec. This synchronism between the pulsatile arterial and venous BFV indicates that the residual pulsation, still occurring at the arterial proximal level, is compensated by a passive compression-distension of the SS with no blood volume (that is net flow) crossing the intracranial vasculature.},

Stable increases in venous pressure consistently induced arteriolar vasodilation, which averaged 6-12\% of the control diameter. The vasodilation occurred when arterial blood pressure was normal and during arterial hypotension induced by bleeding; it also occurred irrespective of whether intracranial pressure was kept constant or was allowed to increase venous hypertension. The results are consistent with the view that autoregulatory adjustments in caliber of pial arterioles are mediated predominantly by metabolic rather than myogenic mechanisms.},

Dynamic-susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI, also known as bolus-tracking MRI, is a dynamic MRI method to measure perfusion and other related hemodynamic parameters. This review article describes the principles involved in perfusion quantification using DSC-MRI as well as discusses the main issues affecting its quantification in patient studies. CONCLUSIONS: It is shown that DSC-MRI is a very powerful technique that provides important information regarding cerebral hemodynamics. The relatively high contrast-to-noise ratio, fast acquisition, and wealth of information available have made DSC-MRI the most commonly used MRI technique for the rapid assessment of the brain hemodynamics in clinical investigations. While very important advances have been achieved in the last 2 decades, there are still some remaining limitations that users should be aware of to avoid misinterpretation of the findings and to make the most of the invaluable information provided by perfusion MRI.},

abstract = {Arterial spin labeling (ASL) can be used to measure perfusion without the use of contrast agents. Due to the small volume fraction of blood vessels compared to tissue in the human brain (typ. 3-5\%) ASL techniques have an intrinsically low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this publication, evidence is presented that the SNR can be improved by using arterial spin labeling in combination with single-shot 3D readout techniques. Specifically, a single-shot 3D-GRASE sequence is presented, which yields a 2.8-fold increase in SNR compared to 2D EPI at the same nominal resolution. Up to 18 slices can be acquired in 2 min with an SNR of 10 or more for gray matter perfusion. A method is proposed to increase the reliability of perfusion quantification using QUIPSS II derivates by acquiring low-resolution maps of the bolus arrival time, which allows differentiation between lack of perfusion and delayed arrival of the labeled blood. For arterial spin labeling, single-shot 3D imaging techniques are optimal in terms of efficiency and might prove beneficial to improve reliability of perfusion quantitation in a clinical setup.},

@article{Wu2007,
abstract = {Arterial spin labeling (ASL) is capable of noninvasively measuring blood flow by magnetically tagging the protons in arterial blood, which has been conventionally achieved using instantaneous (PASL) or continuous (CASL) RF pulses. As an intermediate method, pseudocontinuous ASL (pCASL) utilizes a train of discrete RF pulses to mimic continuous tagging that is often unavailable on imagers due to the requirement of continuous RF transmit capabilities. In the present study, we implemented two versions of pCASL (balanced and unbalanced gradient waveforms in tag and control scans) for both transmit/receive coils and array receivers. Experimental data show a 50\% +/- 4\% increase of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared with PASL and a higher tagging efficiency than amplitude-modulated (AM) CASL (80\% vs. 68\%). Computer simulations predict an optimal tagging efficiency of 85\% for flow velocities from 10 to 60 cm/s. It is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that the tagging efficiency of pCASL is dependent upon the resonance offset and flip angle of the RF pulse train. We conclude that pCASL has the potential of combining the merits of PASL, including less hardware demand and higher tagging efficiency, and CASL, which includes a longer tagging bolus and thus higher SNR. These improvements provide a better balance between tagging efficiency and SNR.},

Equations able to mimic the behavior of the intracranial arterial vascular bed, intracranial venous vascular bed, cerebrospinal fluid absorption and production pro- cesses, and the constancy of overall intracranial volume are separately presented and discussed. The model parameters were given normal values computed using physio- logical considerations and recent anatomical data. In this paper the model is used to simulate the genesis and morphology of the intracranial pressure pulse wave. In par- ticular, dependence of the intracranial pressure pulse amplitude on mean intracranial pressure, obtained from the model, shows excellent agreement with recent experimen- tal findings. The model explains the intracranial pressure pulse wave as the result of the pulsating changes in cerebral blood volume (related to cerebrovascular compli- ance) which occur within a rigid space (i.e., the craniospinal compartmenO. At low and medium values of intracranial pressure, the intracranial pressure pulse amplitude mainly reflects the cerebral pressure-volume relationship. However, during severe intracranial hypertension, an abrupt increase in the cerebrovascular compliance becomes evident, which is reflected in an abrupt increase in the intracranial pressure pulse wave.},

abstract = {The relationship between intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebrospinal fluid dynamics, and the action of cerebral blood-flow (CBF) regulatory mechanisms is examined in this work with the help of an original mathematical model. In building the model, particular emphasis is placed on reproducing the mechanical properties of proximal cerebral arteries and small pial arterioles, and their active regulatory response to perfusion pressure and cerebral blood flow changes. The model allows experimental results on cerebral vessel dilatation and cerebral blood-flow regulation, following cerebral perfusion pressure decrease, to be satisfactorily reproduced. Moreover, the effect of cerebral blood volume changes--induced by autoregulatory adjustments--on the intracranial pressure time pattern can be examined at different levels of arterial hypotension. The results obtained with normal parameter values demonstrate that, at the lower limits of autoregulation, when dilatation of small arterioles becomes maximal, the increase in cerebral blood volume can cause a significant, transient increase in intracranial pressure. This antagonism between intracranial pressure and autoregulatory adjustments can lead to instability of the intracranial system in pathological conditions. In particular, analysis of the linearized system "in the small" demonstrates that an impairment in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reabsorption, a decrease in intracranial compliance and a high-regulatory capacity of the cerebrovascular bed are all conditions which can lead the system equilibrium to become unstable (i.e., the real part of at least one eigenvalue to turn out positive). Accordingly, mathematical simulation "in the large," in the above-mentioned conditions, exhibits intracranial pressure periodic fluctuations which closely resemble, in amplitude, duration, frequency and shape, the well-known Lundberg A-waves (or plateau waves).},

abstract = {A simple mathematical model of intracranial pressure (ICP) dynamics oriented to clinical practice is presented. It includes the hemodynamics of the arterial-arteriolar cerebrovascular bed, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production and reabsorption processes, the nonlinear pressure-volume relationship of the craniospinal compartment, and a Starling resistor mechanism for the cerebral veins. Moreover, arterioles are controlled by cerebral autoregulation mechanisms, which are simulated by means of a time constant and a sigmoidal static characteristic. The model is used to simulate interactions between ICP, cerebral blood volume, and autoregulation. Three different related phenomena are analyzed: the generation of plateau waves, the effect of acute arterial hypotension on ICP, and the role of cerebral hemodynamics during pressure-volume index (PVI) tests. Simulation results suggest the following: 1) ICP dynamics may become unstable in patients with elevated CSF outflow resistance and decreased intracranial compliance, provided cerebral autoregulation is efficient. Instability manifests itself with the occurrence of self-sustained plateau waves. 2) Moderate acute arterial hypotension may have completely different effects on ICP, depending on the value of model parameters. If physiological compensatory mechanisms (CSF circulation and intracranial storage capacity) are efficient, acute hypotension has only negligible effects on ICP and cerebral blood flow (CBF). If these compensatory mechanisms are poor, even modest hypotension may induce a large transient increase in ICP and a significant transient reduction in CBF, with risks of secondary brain damage. 3) The ICP response to a bolus injection (PVI test) is sharply affected, via cerebral blood volume changes, by cerebral hemodynamics and autoregulation. We suggest that PVI tests may be used to extract information not only on intracranial compliance and CSF circulation, but also on the status of mechanisms controlling CBF.},

In recent years computational models, and it must be noted computer architecture have evolved to an extent where mathematicians and engineers can play a large part in discovering how the brain functions physiologically as well as investigating pathological conditions. This review will look at a number of increasingly complex computational models of blood flow to the brain and how variations in arterial geometry can influence the perfusion in the cerebral vasculature.

Physical models required for CFD simulation were introduced including a model for arterial wall motion due to fluid-wall interactions, a shear thinning fluid model of blood, a vascular bed model for outflow boundary conditions, and a model for autoregulation mechanism. The three-dimensional unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations coupled with these models were solved iteratively using the pseudocompressibility method and dual time stepping. Gravity source terms were added to the Navier-Stokes equations to take the effect of gravity into account. For the treatment of complex geometry, a chimera overset grid technique was adopted to obtain connectivity between arterial branches. For code validation, computed results were compared with experimental data for both steady-state and time-dependent flows. This computational approach was then applied to blood flows through a realistic carotid bifurcation and two Circle of Willis models, one using an idealized geometry and the other using an anatomical data set. A three-dimensional Circle of Willis configuration was reconstructed from subject-specific magnetic resonance images using an image segmentation method. Through the numerical simulation of blood flow in two model problems, namely, the carotid bifurcation and the brain arteries, it was observed that the altered gravity has considerable effects on arterial contraction/dilatation and consequent changes in flow conditions.},

Considerable controversy exists about fluid and pressure dynamics, and about how the brain responds to changes in flow patterns and compression in hydrocephalus. This paper presents a new model based on the first principles of fluid mechanics. This model of fluid-structure interactions predicts flows and pressures throughout the brain's ventricular pathways consistent with both animal intracranial pressure (ICP) measurements and human CINE phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging data. The computations provide approximations of the tissue deformations of the brain parenchyma. The model also quantifies the pulsatile CSF motion including flow reversal in the aqueduct as well as the changes in ICPs due to brain tissue compression. It does not require the existence of large transmural pressure differences as the force for ventricular expansion.

abstract = {Advances in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques enable the accurate measurements of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow in the human brain. In addition, image reconstruction tools facilitate the collection of patient-specific brain geometry data such as the exact dimensions of the ventricular and subarachnoidal spaces (SAS) as well as the computer-aided reconstruction of the CSF-filled spaces. The solution of the conservation of CSF mass and momentum balances over a finite computational mesh obtained from the MR images predict the patients' CSF flow and pressure field. Advanced image reconstruction tools used in conjunction with first principles of fluid mechanics allow an accurate verification of the CSF flow patters for individual patients. This paper presents a detailed analysis of pulsatile CSF flow and pressure dynamics in a normal and hydrocephalic patient. Experimental CSF flow measurements and computational results of flow and pressure fields in the ventricular system, the SAS and brain parenchyma are presented. The pulsating CSF motion is explored in normal and pathological conditions of communicating hydrocephalus. This paper predicts small transmantle pressure differences between lateral ventricles and SASs (approximately 10 Pa). The transmantle pressure between ventricles and SAS remains small even in the hydrocephalic patient (approximately 30 Pa), but the ICP pulsatility increases by a factor of four. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) results of the predicted CSF flow velocities are in good agreement with Cine MRI measurements. Differences between the predicted and observed CSF flow velocities in the prepontine area point towards complex brain-CSF interactions. The paper presents the complete computational model to predict the pulsatile CSF flow in the cranial cavity.},

abstract = {Raised intracranial pressure (ICP) and low cerebral blood flow (CBF) are associated with ischaemia and poor outcome after brain injury. Therefore, many management protocols target these parameters. This overview summarizes the technical aspects of ICP and CBF monitoring, and their role in the clinical management of brain-injured patients. Furthermore, some applications of these methods in current research are highlighted. ICP is typically measured using probes that are inserted into one of the lateral ventricles or the brain parenchyma. Therapeutic measures used to control ICP have relevant side-effects and continuous monitoring is essential to guide such therapies. ICP is also required to calculate cerebral perfusion pressure which is one of the most important therapeutic targets in brain-injured patients. Several bedside CBF monitoring devices are available. However, most do not measure CBF but rather a parameter that is thought to be proportional to CBF. Frequently used methods include transcranial Doppler which measures blood flow velocity and may be helpful for the diagnosis and monitoring of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid haemorrhage or jugular bulb oximetry which gives information on adequacy of CBF in relation to the metabolic demand of the brain. However, there is no clear evidence that incorporating data from CBF monitors into our management strategies improves outcome in brain-injured patients.},

abstract = {The majority of contemporary hydrocephalus valves are designed to introduce a low resistance to flow into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage pathway, and an therefore intended to stabilise intracranial pressure (ICP) at a level close to the shunt's operating pressure. However, this goal cannot always be attained. Accelerated CSF drainage with vertical body posture in ventriculo-peritoneal shunts is one reason for the ICP decreasing below the shunt's operating pressure. Another possible factor has been studied: the impact of the pulsating pattern in the ICP on the operating pressure. Six popular constructions of medium-pressure valves were studied (Radionics Low-profile, Delta, Hakim Precision, Holter, Integra In-line and Hakim NMT). Valves were mounted in the testing rig in the UK. Shunt Evaluation Laboratory and perfused with de-ionised water at a rate of 0.3 ml min(-1), and proximal pulsating pressures of different amplitudes (from 2 to 30mmHg peak-to-peak) and frequencies (70-10 cycles min(-1)) were superimposed. Laboratory findings were compared with clinical material containing recordings of ICP made in patients to diagnose reasons for ventriculomegaly. The mean operating pressure decreased in all valves when the simulated amplitude of heart pulsations increased. The rate of this decrease was dependent on the type of valve (variable from 2.5 to 5 mm Hg per increase in peak-to-peak amplitude by 10 mm Hg). The decrease was not related to the frequency of the wave. The relationship between pulse amplitude and ICP in 35 patients with blocked shunts was strong (R = 0.48; p < 0.03; slope 0.14) and in 25 patients with properly functioning shunts was non-significant (R = 0.057; p = 0.765). Two examples of decrease in mean ICP in the presence of increased vasogenic ICP waves in shunted patients are presented. The shunt operating pressure, which 'sets' the ICP in shunted patients may be influenced by the dynamics of a patient's ICP waveform.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We have previously reported a model of cerebral hydrodynamics in the form of an equivalent electrical circuit. The aim of this work was to demonstrate that the model could predict venous flow patterns seen in the superior sagittal sinus (SSS), straight sinus (STS), and jugular vein (JV) in normal volunteers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An electrical equivalence model of CSF and cerebral blood flow was fitted to measured arterial and CSF data from 16 healthy volunteers. Predictions of the venous outflow waveform derived from the model were compared with measured venous flows in the SSS, STS, and JV. RESULTS: The model accurately predicted the measured jugular waveform. The measured waveforms from SSS and STS showed a less pronounced and delayed systolic peak compared with the predicted outflow. The fitted bulk model parameters provided relative values that correspond approximately to the impedance of arterial capillaries (1.0), cerebral aqueduct ( approximately 0), venous capillaries ( approximately 0), and arteries (0.01) and for the elastic capacitance of the ventricles (4.11), capillaries ( approximately 0), and veins (271). The elastic capacitance of the major cerebral arteries was large and could not be accurately determined. CONCLUSIONS: We have confirmed the ability of the model to predict the venous waveforms in healthy persons. The absence of any statistically significant component of the venous waveform not described by the model implies that measurements of venous flow could be used to constrain further the model-fitting process.},

The recurrent artery of Heubner was frequently exposed before the A-1 segment in defining the neck on anterior cerebral aneurysms because it commonly courses anterior to A-1. It arose from the A-2 segment of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) in 78\% and most commonly terminated in the area of the anterior perforated substance, and lateral to it in the Sylvian fissure. The anterior communicating artery (ACoA) frequently gave rise to perforating arteries which terminated in the superior surface of the optic chiasm and above the chiasm in the anterior hypothalamus. This finding contrasts with previous reports that no perforating branches arise from the communicating artery. The proximal half of the A=1 segment was a richer source of perforating arteries than the distal half. The A-1 branches most commonly terminated in the anterior perforated substance, the optic chiasm, and the region of the optic tract. The ACoA increased in size as the difference in the diameter between the right and left A-1 segments increased. Frequent variants such as double or triple ACoA's, triple A-2 segments, and duplication of the A-1 segments were encountered. The clinical consequences of occlusion of the recurrent artery and of the perforators from the ACoA and medial and lateral segment of A-1 are reviewed.},

abstract = {The results are presented of a statistical analysis of the variability of the circle of Willis using univariate and bivariate methods. For this purpose 100 circles of Willis were available. From each circle 19 indexes of arterial size were determined, the basilar artery was measured in two places. Half the circumference was measured. This data yielded no evidence of differences between left- and right-sided vessels in the sample. An important source of variation is the general size of all vessels considered. When the data are cleared from this general size variation, correlation coefficients reveal interesting relations between the vessels. The posterior communicating arteries are strongly related to the ipsilateral carotid artery, whereas a strong inverse relationship exists with the basilar artery and the precommunicating part of the ipsilateral posterior cerebral artery. These relationships can be understood from the expected patterns of the blood flow in these vessels. Similar relationships can be found in the anterior part of the circle of Willis and in the vertebro-basilar junction. In a different manner, based on previous haemodynamic studies, the relation between blood flow and vessel size within the circle of Willis can be demonstrated by relating the ratios of the sizes of afferent and efferent arteries to the sizes of the posterior communicating arteries, an "intuitive" model. The supposed correlations of the outcome of this "intuitive" model with the size of the communicating arteries appeared to by highly significant. It is concluded that the variations of the circle of Willis are related to the individual variations of the blood flow in this arterial network.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Collateral circulatory pathways are considered the primary determinant of cerebral hemodynamics in patients with obstructive lesions of the internal carotid arteries (ICaAs). However, the hemodynamic effects of the diameter of the anterior communicating artery (ACoA) have never been assessed quantitatively in humans. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two different mathematical models were used to simulate changes affecting blood pressures and flows in cerebral arteries as a function of ACoA diameter and ICaA stenoses or occlusions. Small changes in ACoA diameter were found to have marked hemodynamic effects when they occurred within the range of 0.4 to 1.6 mm, a situation observed in 80\% of the cases. Outside this range, changes in ACoA diameter had no effect. Simulated pressure drops through a stenotic ICaA were consistent with those observed. They were found to depend on the degrees of the stenoses in both ICaAs and on ACoA diameter according to a simple equation. Pressure reserve in the middle and anterior cerebral arteries decreased to below the lower limit of autoregulation, despite a normal mean arterial blood pressure, when the arteries were distal to a unique 70\% ICaA stenosis associated with a small-diameter ACoA or to a 50\% ICaA stenosis associated with a contralateral ICaA occlusion and a large-diameter ACoA. Above these thresholds, the circle of Willis allowed for an almost complete global cerebral blood flow compensation that involved all the afferent and communicating vessels. CONCLUSIONS: ACoA diameter strongly modulates the effects of ICaA lesions on cerebral hemodynamics. Some proposals for endarterectomy indications can be derived from our study.},

abstract = {Measurement of tissue perfusion is important for the functional assessment of organs in vivo. Here we report the use of 1H NMR imaging to generate perfusion maps in the rat brain at 4.7 T. Blood water flowing to the brain is saturated in the neck region with a slice-selective saturation imaging sequence, creating an endogenous tracer in the form of proximally saturated spins. Because proton T1 times are relatively long, particularly at high field strengths, saturated spins exchange with bulk water in the brain and a steady state is created where the regional concentration of saturated spins is determined by the regional blood flow and regional T1. Distal saturation applied equidistantly outside the brain serves as a control for effects of the saturation pulses. Average cerebral blood flow in normocapnic rat brain under halothane anesthesia was determined to be 105 +/- 16 cc.100 g-1.min-1 (mean +- SEM, n = 3), in good agreement with values reported in the literature, and was sensitive to increases in arterial pCO2. This technique allows regional perfusion maps to be measured noninvasively, with the resolution of 1H MRI, and should be readily applicable to human studies.},

abstract = {A technique has been developed for proton magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of perfusion, using water as a freely diffusable tracer, and its application to the measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the rat is demonstrated. The method involves labeling the inflowing water proton spins in the arterial blood by inverting them continuously at the neck region and observing the effects of inversion on the intensity of brain MRI. Solution to the Bloch equations, modified to include the effects of flow, allows regional perfusion rates to be measured from an image with spin inversion, a control image, and a T1 image. Continuous spin inversion labeling the arterial blood water was accomplished, using principles of adiabatic fast passage by applying continuous-wave radio-frequency power in the presence of a magnetic field gradient in the direction of arterial flow. In the detection slice used to measure perfusion, whole brain CBF averaged 1.39 +/- 0.19 ml.g-1. min-1 (mean +/- SEM, n = 5). The technique's sensitivity to changes in CBF was measured by using graded hypercarbia, a condition that is known to increase brain perfusion. CBF vs. pCO2 data yield a best-fit straight line described by CBF (ml.g-1.min-1) = 0.052pCO2 (mm Hg) - 0.173, in excellent agreement with values in the literature. Finally, perfusion images of a freeze-injured rat brain have been obtained, demonstrating the technique's ability to detect regional abnormalities in perfusion.},

@article{Wong1997,
abstract = {We describe here experimental considerations in the implementation of quantitative perfusion imaging techniques for functional MRI using pulsed arterial spin labeling. Three tagging techniques: EPISTAR, PICORE, and FAIR are found to give very similar perfusion results despite large differences in static tissue contrast. Two major sources of systematic error in the perfusion measurement are identified: the transit delay from the tagging region to the imaging slice; and the inclusion of intravascular tagged signal. A modified technique called QUIPSS II is described that decreases sensitivity to these effects by explicitly controlling the time width of the tag bolus and imaging after the bolus is entirely deposited into the slice. With appropriate saturation pulses the pulse sequence can be arranged so as to allow for simultaneous collection of perfusion and BOLD data that can be cleanly separated. Such perfusion and BOLD signals reveal differences in spatial location and dynamics that may be useful both for functional brain mapping and for study of the BOLD contrast mechanism. The implementation of multislice perfusion imaging introduces additional complications, primarily in the elimination of signal from static tissue. In pulsed ASL, this appears to be related to the slice profile of the inversion tag pulse in the presence of relaxation, rather than magnetization transfer effects as in continuous arterial spin labeling, and can be alleviated with careful adjustment of inversion pulse parameters.},

abstract = {Arterial spin labeling (ASL) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful noninvasive technique to investigate the physiological status of brain tissue by measuring cerebral blood flow (CBF). ASL assesses the inflow of magnetically labeled arterial blood into an imaging voxel. In the last 2 decades, various ASL sequences have been proposed which differ in their ease of implementation and their sensitivity to artifacts. In addition, several quantification methods have been developed to determine the absolute value of CBF from ASL magnetization difference images. In this study, we evaluated three pulsed ASL sequences and three absolute quantification schemes. It was found that FAIR-QUIPSSII implementation of ASL yields 10-20\% higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and 18\% higher CBF as compared with PICORE-Q2TIPS (with FOCI pulses) and PICORE-QUIPSSII (with BASSI pulses). In addition, quantification schemes employed can give rise to up to a 35\% difference in CBF values. We conclude that, although all quantitative ASL sequences and CBF calibration methods should in principle result in the similar CBF values and image quality, substantial differences in CBF values and SNR were found. Thus, comparing studies using different ASL sequences and analysis algorithms is likely to result in erroneous intra- and intergroup differences. Therefore, (i) the same quantification schemes should consistently be used, and (ii) quantification using local tissue proton density should yield the most accurate CBF values because, although still requiring definitive demonstration in future studies, the proton density of blood is assumed to be very similar to the value of gray matter.},

However, residual errors remain due to incomplete saturation of spins over the slab-shaped tagged region by the QUIPSS II saturation pulse, and spatial mismatch of the distal edge of the saturation and inversion slice profiles. By replacing the original QUIPSS II saturation pulse with a train of thin-slice periodic saturation pulses applied at the distal end of the tagged region, the accuracy of perfusion quantitation is improved. Results of single and multislice studies are reported.},

abstract = {Arterial spin labeling (ASL) techniques are MR imaging methods designed to measure the endogenous perfusion signal coming from arterial blood by manipulation of its magnetization. These methods are based on the subtraction of two consecutively acquired images: one acquired after preparation of the arterial blood magnetization upstream to the area of interest, and the second without any manipulation of its arterial magnetization. The subtraction of both images provides information on the perfusion of the tissue present in the slice of interest. Because ASL is a very low SNR technique, the shift from 1.5 T to 3.0 T should be regarded as a great way to increase signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore, the concomitant increase in blood T1 should improve the SNR of ASL further. Other effects related to poorer magnetic filed homogeneities and reduced T2 relaxation times, however, will counterbalance both effects partially. In this article, the pros and cons of the use of ASL at high field are summarized, after a brief description of the major techniques used and their theoretical limitations. Finally, a summary of the few existing dedicated ASL perfusion techniques available are presented. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

It is shown that a radiofrequency field at right angles to the constant field causes a forced precession of the total polarization around the constant field with decreasing latitude as the Larmor frequency approaches adiabatically the frequency of the r-f field. Thus there results a component of the nuclear polarization at right angles to both the constant and the r-f field and it is shown that under normal laboratory conditions this component can induce observable voltages. In Section 3 we discuss this nuclear induction, considering the effect of external fields only, while in Section 4 those modifications are described which originate from internal fields and finite relaxation times.},

This is particularly useful in the field of functional imaging, where accurate measurements of perfusion change can help untangle the complex physiological changes that occur following neuronal activation. However, the linearity of the perfusion estimate over a wide range of perfusion values may be more important than absolute values. For several years, single-compartment models have dominated the literature, and it has been assumed that the labeled water diffuses freely throughout the tissue voxel. However, recent work, as summarized in this review, has shown that this assumption is inaccurate and leads to an overestimation of perfusion at low perfusion rates, and an underestimation at high rates. The inclusion of restricted permeability of the capillary wall to water in a two-compartment model offers improved quantification.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To test the feasibility of pediatric perfusion imaging using a pulsed arterial spin labeling (ASL) technique at 1.5 T. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ASL perfusion imaging was carried out on seven neurologically normal children and five healthy adults. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the perfusion images along with T1, M(0), arterial transit time, and the temporal fluctuation of the ASL image series were measured and compared between the two age groups. In addition, ASL perfusion magnetic resonance (MR) was performed on three children with neurologic disorder. RESULTS: In the cohort of neurologically normal children, a 70\% increase in the SNR of the ASL perfusion images and a 30\% increase in the absolute cerebral blood flow compared to the adult data were observed. The measures of ASL SNR, T1, and M(0) were found to decrease linearly with age. Transit time and temporal fluctuation of the ASL perfusion image series were not significantly different between the two age groups. The feasibility of ASL in the diagnosis of pediatric neurologic disease was also illustrated. CONCLUSION: ASL is a promising tool for pediatric perfusion imaging given the unique and reciprocal benefits in terms of safety and image quality.},

abstract = {In an age where the amount of data collected from brain imaging is increasing constantly, it is of critical importance to analyse those data within an accepted framework to ensure proper integration and comparison of the information collected. This book describes the ideas and procedures that underlie the analysis of signals produced by the brain. The aim is to understand how the brain works, in terms of its functional architecture and dynamics. This book provides the background and methodology for the analysis of all types of brain imaging data, from functional magnetic resonance imaging to magnetoencephalography. Critically, Statistical Parametric Mapping provides a widely accepted conceptual framework which allows treatment of all these different modalities. This rests on an understanding of the brain's functional anatomy and the way that measured signals are caused experimentally. The book takes the reader from the basic concepts underlying the analysis of neuroimaging data to cutting edge approaches that would be difficult to find in any other source. Critically, the material is presented in an incremental way so that the reader can understand the precedents for each new development. This book will be particularly useful to neuroscientists engaged in any form of brain mapping; who have to contend with the real-world problems of data analysis and understanding the techniques they are using. It is primarily a scientific treatment and a didactic introduction to the analysis of brain imaging data. It can be used as both a textbook for students and scientists starting to use the techniques, as well as a reference for practicing neuroscientists. The book also serves as a companion to the software packages that have been developed for brain imaging data analysis.},

abstract = {Denoising is critical to improving the quality and stability of cerebral blood flow (CBF) quantification in arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) due to the intrinsic low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) of ASL data. Previous studies have been focused on reducing the spatial or temporal noise using standard filtering techniques, and less attention has been paid to two global nuisance effects, the residual motion artifacts and the global signal fluctuations. Since both nuisances affect the whole brain, removing them in advance should enhance the CBF quantification quality for ASL MRI. The purpose of this paper was to assess this potential benefit. Three methods were proposed to suppress each or both of the two global nuisances. Their performances for CBF quantification were validated using ASL data acquired from 13 subjects. Evaluation results showed that covarying out both global nuisances significantly improved temporal SNR and test-retest stability of CBF measurement. Although the concept of removing both nuisances is not technically novel per se, this paper clearly showed the benefits for ASL CBF quantification. Dissemination of the proposed methods in a free ASL data processing toolbox should be of interest to a broad range of ASL users. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

A second vascular artifact arises from relaxation of "tagged" arterial blood during transit from the tagging plane to the capillary exchange site in the imaging slice. This artifact can be corrected if the arterial transit times are measured by using "dynamic" spin tagging approaches.

METHODS: Twenty-five subjects with AD, 25 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 25 cognitively normal (CN) subjects underwent isotropic volumetric T1-weighted imaging and pulsed ASL MRI. All subjects were divided into carrier or noncarriers of the epsilon4 allele. Voxel-based statistical analyses were performed among groups on rCBF by ANOVA tests. In each subject group, we also evaluated the rCBF change between carrier and noncarrier groups. RESULTS: rCBF was significantly reduced in AD subjects compared to other subjects. In CN and AD subjects, rCBF in the carrier group was significantly reduced in several areas of the brain compared with that of the noncarrier group. In the carrier group, rCBF was significantly increased in the right parahippocampal gyrus, the bilateral cingulate gyri and the right posterior cingulate on the MCI group in addition to the right superior frontal gyrus in the AD group. CONCLUSION: rCBF in the CN and AD groups were significantly reduced in the subjects with the carriers of the epsilon4 allele, which is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. In addition, rCBF in the MCI group was significantly increased in subjects who were carriers. Therefore, rCBF can be used as a biomarker to show disease progression in areas of the brain of MCI subjects.},

abstract = {Partial volume effects (PVE) are a consequence of limited spatial resolution in brain imaging. In arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI, the problem is exacerbated by the nonlinear dependency of the ASL signal on magnetization contributions from each tissue within an imaged voxel. We have developed an algorithm that corrects for PVE in ASL imaging. The algorithm is based on a model that represents the voxel intensity as a weighted sum of pure tissue contribution, where the weighting coefficients are the tissue's fractional volume in the voxel. Using this algorithm, we were able to estimate cerebral blood flow (CBF) for gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) independently. The average voxelwise ratio of GM to WM CBF was approximately 3.2, in good agreement with reports in the literature. As proof of concept, data from PVE-corrected method were compared with those from the conventional, PVE-uncorrected method. As hypothesized, the two yielded similar CBF values for voxels containing >95\% GM and differed in proportion with the voxels' heterogeneity. More importantly, the GM CBF assessed with the PVE-corrected method was independent of the voxels' heterogeneity, implying that estimation of flow was unaffected by PVE. An example of application of this algorithm in motor-activation data is also given.},

Recently a partial volume (PV) correction method for ASL has been demonstrated (Asllani et al. Magn Reson Med 2008; 60:1362-1371), where PV estimates were used with a local linear regression to separate the GM and white matter ASL signal. Here a new PV correction method for multi-inversion time ASL is proposed that exploits PV estimates within a spatially regularized kinetic curve model analysis. The proposed method exploits both PV estimates and the different kinetics of the ASL signal arising from GM and white matter. The new correction method is shown, on both simulated and real data, to provide correction of GM CBF comparable to a linear regression approach, whilst preserving greater spatial detail in the CBF image. On real data corrected GM CBF values were found to be largely independent of GM PV, implying that the correction had been successful. Increases of mean GM CBF after correction of 69-80\% were observed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: On MR imaging, white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on T2-weighted images are generally considered as a surrogate marker of ischemic small vessel disease in elderly subjects. Pulsed arterial spin-labeling (PASL) is a noninvasive MR perfusion-weighted technique. We hypothesized that elderly subjects with diffuse confluent WMH should have lower cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurements than subjects with punctiform or beginning confluent WMH. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MR images of 21 subjects (13 women; mean age, 76 years; SD, 5), stratified for the degree of WMH, from a single center within the multinational Leukoaraiosis and Disability (LADIS) study, were investigated. CBF images were obtained by means of quantitative imaging of perfusion by using a single-subtraction second version, with thin-section TI periodic saturation PASL. Values of cortical gray matter, subcortical (including white matter and deep gray matter), and global CBF were calculated. CBF measurements of subjects with diffuse confluent WMH (n = 7) were compared with those of subjects with punctiform or beginning confluent WMH (n = 14). RESULTS: Subjects with diffuse confluent WMH were found to have approximately 20\% lower mean global CBF (43.5 mL/100 mL/min; SD, 6.3) than subjects with punctiform or beginning confluent WMH (57.9 mL/100 mL/min; SD, 8.6; P < .01), as well as approximately 20\% lower mean subcortical (P < .01) and cortical gray matter CBF (P < .05). CONCLUSION: PASL revealed a significant reduction of CBF measurements in elderly subjects with diffuse confluent WMH.},

To date, no study has explored the effect of caffeine on brain activation patterns during highly demanding cognitive tasks in the elderly.This prospective, placebo-controlled crossover design comprises 24 healthy elderly individuals (mean age 68.8. ??. 4.0. years, 17 females) performing a 2-back working memory (WM) task in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Analyses include complimentary assessment of task-related activations (general linear model, GLM), functional connectivity (tensorial independent component analysis, TICA), and baseline perfusion (arterial spin labeling).Despite a reduction in whole-brain global perfusion (-22.7\%), caffeine-enhanced task-related GLM activation in a local and distributed network is most pronounced in the bilateral striatum and to a lesser degree in the right middle and inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral insula, left superior and inferior parietal lobule as well as in the cerebellum bilaterally. TICA was significantly enhanced (+8.2\%) in caffeine versus placebo in a distributed and task-relevant network including the pre-frontal cortex, the supplementary motor area, the ventral premotor cortex and the parietal cortex as well as the occipital cortex (visual stimuli) and basal ganglia. The inverse comparison of placebo versus caffeine had no significant difference. Activation strength of the task-relevant-network component correlated with response accuracy for caffeine yet not for placebo, indicating a selective cognitive effect of caffeine.The present findings suggest that acute caffeine intake enhances WM-related brain activation as well as functional connectivity of blood oxygen level-dependent fMRI in elderly individuals. ?? 2013 IBRO.},

The prevalence and clinical significance of these ILs are not known. The MRI and clinical records of 86 consecutive patients who underwent technically satisfactory brain imaging at a large urban referral center were reviewed. Patients with definite or probably demyelinating disease were excluded. Incidental lesions were defined as parenchymal areas of increased signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging, which could not be directly explained by the patient's current clinical diagnosis, neurological status, or computed tomographic (CT) scan. The ILs were noted and graded according to size, multiplicity, and location and were correlated with age, clinical presentation, CT scan findings, and risk factors for cerebrovascular disease. One or more IL were identified in 22\% of patients under 40 years of age, in 57\% of patients 41 to 60 years of age, and in 90\% of patients over 60 years of age. Large patches of confluent ILs were not encountered in any patient less than 40 years of age; they were present in 10\% of patients 41 to 60 years of age, and in 30\% of patients over 60 years of age. The incidence of severity of ILs correlated significantly with age (P less than 0.0005) and with risk factors for cerebrovascular disease (P less than 0.02). Patients with most severe ILs also had areas of vague periventricular leukomalacia on the CT scan. The clinical significance of incidental MRI lesions in various age groups is discussed in detail.},

abstract = {In Multiple Sclerosis (MS), detection of T2-hyperintense white matter (WM) lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a crucial criterion for diagnosis and predicting prognosis in early disease. Automated lesion detection is not only desirable with regard to time and cost effectiveness but also constitutes a prerequisite to minimize user bias. Here, we developed and evaluated an algorithm for automated lesion detection requiring a three-dimensional (3D) gradient echo (GRE) T1-weighted and a FLAIR image at 3 Tesla (T). Our tool determines the three tissue classes of gray matter (GM) and WM as well as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the T1-weighted image, and, then, the FLAIR intensity distribution of each tissue class in order to detect outliers, which are interpreted as lesion beliefs. Next, a conservative lesion belief is expanded toward a liberal lesion belief. To this end, neighboring voxels are analyzed and assigned to lesions under certain conditions. This is done iteratively until no further voxels are assigned to lesions. Herein, the likelihood of belonging to WM or GM is weighed against the likelihood of belonging to lesions. We evaluated our algorithm in 53 MS patients with different lesion volumes, in 10 patients with posterior fossa lesions, and 18 control subjects that were all scanned at the same 3T scanner (Achieva, Philips, Netherlands). We found good agreement with lesions determined by manual tracing (R2 values of over 0.93 independent of FLAIR slice thickness up to 6. mm).

@article{Wang2008,
abstract = {Arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion fMRI data differ in important respects from the more familiar blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI data and require specific processing strategies. In this paper, we examined several factors that may influence ASL data analysis, including data storage bit resolution, motion correction, preprocessing for cerebral blood flow (CBF) calculations and nuisance covariate modeling. Continuous ASL data were collected at 3 T from 10 subjects while they performed a simple sensorimotor task with an epoch length of 48 s. These data were then analyzed using systematic variations of the factors listed above to identify the approach that yielded optimal signal detection for task activation. Improvements in statistical power were found for use of at least 10 bits for data storage at 3 T. No significant difference was found in motor cortex regarding using simple subtraction or sinc subtraction, but the former presented minor but significantly (P<.024) larger peak t value in visual cortex. While artifactual head motion patterns were observed in synthetic data and background-suppressed ASL data when label/control images were realigned to a common target, independent realignment of label and control images did not yield significant improvements in activation in the sensorimotor data. It was also found that CBF calculations should be performed prior to spatial normalization and that modeling of global fluctuations yielded significantly increased peak t value in motor cortex. The implementation of all ASL data processing approaches is easily accomplished within an open-source toolbox, ASLtbx, and is advocated for most perfusion fMRI data sets. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Normal aging is associated with diminished brain perfusion measured as cerebral blood flow (CBF), but previously it is difficult to accurately measure various aspects of perfusion hemodynamics including: bolus arrival times and delays through small arterioles, expressed as arterial-arteriole transit time. To study hemodynamics in greater detail, volumetric arterial spin labeling MRI with variable postlabeling delays was used together with a distributed, dual-compartment tracer model. The main goal was to determine how CBF and other perfusion hemodynamics vary with aging. Twenty cognitive normal female and 15 male subjects (age: 23-84 years old) were studied at 4 T. Arterial spin labeling measurements were performed in the posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and whole brain gray matter. CBF declined with advancing age (P < 0.001). Separately from variations in bolus arrival times, arterial-arteriole transit time increased with advancing age (P < 0.01). Finally, women had overall higher CBF values (P < 0.01) and shorter arterial-arteriole transit time (P < 0.01) than men, regardless of age. The findings imply that CBF and blood transit times are compromised in aging, and these changes together with differences between genders should be taken into account when studying brain perfusion.},

@article{Rubin2012,
abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Hyperglycemia has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although numerous studies have demonstrated that hyperglycemia is associated with the atherosis component of atherosclerosis, limited studies have addressed the independent role of hyperglycemia in the pathophysiology of sclerotic vascular disease. We hypothesized that hyperglycemia, as assessed by hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), would be independently associated two common indices of arterial stiffness (pressure-strain elastic modulus (Ep) and Young's elastic modulus (YEM)). METHODS: We examined the cross-sectional association between HbA1c and arterial stiffness using B-mode ultrasound examination of the carotid artery in 9050 participants from the community-based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. We used multivariable linear and logistic regression models to characterize the association between HbA1c and increased Ep and YEM. RESULTS: Higher values of HbA1c were associated in a graded fashion with increased arterial stiffness (P-trend < 0.001 for both EP and YEM). After adjusting for traditional risk factors, increasing HbA1c deciles were significantly associated with elevated EP (OR for the highest decile of HbA1c compared to the lowest, 2.01, 95\% CI: 1.30, 3.11) and YEM (OR = 1.71, 95\% CI: 1.15, 2.55). CONCLUSION: Elevated HbA1c is associated with measures of increased arterial stiffness, even after accounting for arterial wall thickness. This is consistent with the hypothesis that hyperglycemia contributes to arterial stiffness beyond its effects on atherosis and suggests that hyperglycemia is associated with altered material within the arterial wall.},

@article{Chen2011,
abstract = {Prior studies have demonstrated decreasing cerebral blood flow (CBF) in normal aging, but the full spatial pattern and potential mechanism of changes in CBF remain to be elucidated. Specifically, existing data have not been entirely consistent regarding the spatial distribution of such changes, potentially a result of neglecting the effect of age-related tissue atrophy in CBF measurements. In this work, we use pulsed arterial-spin labelling to quantify regional CBF in 86 cognitively and physically healthy adults, aged 23 to 88. years. Surface-based analyses were utilized to map regional decline in CBF and cortical thickness with advancing age, and to examine the spatial associations and dissociations between these metrics. Our results demonstrate regionally selective age-related reductions in cortical perfusion, involving the superior-frontal, orbito-frontal, superior-parietal, middle-inferior temporal, insular, precuneus, supramarginal, lateral-occipital and cingulate regions, while subcortical CBF was relatively preserved in aging. Regional effects of age on CBF differed from that of grey-matter atrophy. In addition, the pattern of CBF associations with age displays an interesting similarity with the default-mode network. These findings demonstrate the dissociation between regional CBF and structural alterations specific to normal aging, and augment our understanding of mechanisms of pathology in older adults. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Brumm2010,
abstract = {Although the acute stroke literature indicates that cerebral blood flow (CBF) may commonly be disordered in stroke survivors, limited research has investigated whether CBF remains aberrant in the chronic phase of stroke. A directed study of CBF in stroke is needed because reduced CBF (hypoperfusion) may occur in neural regions that appear anatomically intact and may impact cognitive functioning in stroke survivors. Hypoperfusion in neurologically-involved individuals may also affect BOLD signal in FMRI studies, complicating its interpretation with this population. The current study measured CBF in three chronic stroke survivors with ischemic infarcts (greater than 1. year post-stroke) to localize regions of hypoperfusion, and most critically, examine the CBF inflow curve using a methodology that has never, to our knowledge, been reported in the chronic stroke literature. CBF data acquired with a Pulsed Arterial Spin Labeling (PASL) flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) technique indicated both delayed CBF inflow curve and hypoperfusion in the stroke survivors as compared to younger and elderly control participants. Among the stroke survivors, we observed regional hypoperfusion in apparently anatomically intact neural regions that are involved in cognitive functioning. These results may have profound implications for the study of behavioral deficits in chronic stroke, and particularly for studies using neuroimaging methods that rely on CBF to draw conclusions about underlying neural activity. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Cerebral autoregulation (CA) refers to the properties of the brain vascular bed to maintain cerebral perfusion despite changes in blood pressure (BP). Whereas classic studies have assessed CA during changes in BP that have a gradual onset, dynamic studies quantify the fast modifications in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in relation to rapid alterations in BP. There is a lack of standardization in the assessment of dynamic CA. This review provides an overview of the methods that have been applied, with special focus on the elderly. We will discuss the relative merits and shortcomings of these methods with regard to the aged population. Furthermore, we summarize the effects of variability in BP on CBF in older people. Of the various dynamic assessments of CA, a single sit-to-stand procedure is a feasible and physiologic method in the elderly. The collection of spontaneous beat-to-beat changes in BP and CBF allows estimation of CA using the technique of transfer function analysis. A thorough search of the literature yielded eight studies that have measured dynamic CA in the elderly aged <75 years. Regardless of the methods used, it was concluded from these studies that CA was preserved in this population.},

abstract = {In hypertensive patients, the upper and lower limits of cerebral autoregulation are shifted to higher levels. However, the dynamics of cerebral autoregulation in hypertensive patients are less well known. We compared the dynamics of cerebral autoregulation in 21 treated hypertensive patients (13 men and 8 women; mean age: 48.9+/-13.6 years) and in 21 normotensive subjects (13 men and 8 women; mean age: 51+/-14.5 years) by transcranial Doppler (TCD) of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) during the acute decrease in blood pressure induced by standing up after 2 min in squatting position. MCA maximal outline blood flow velocity (FV), blood pressure (Finapres) and end-tidal PCO2 were continuously monitored and computerised. A cerebral vascular resistance index (CR) was calculated as follows: mean arterial BP/MCA mean FV with normalised changes in CR per second during the blood pressure decrease (CR slope). The CR slope reflecting the rate of cerebral autoregulation did not differ between the two groups and within the hypertensive patients [well controlled (8 patients) and not controlled (13 patients)]. The time to maximum decrease of CR (T1) and the time to full recovery of CR after the initial drop (T2) were also similar in the two groups (controls T1: 11.3+/-3.1 s, T2: 12+/-5.9 s; hypertensive T1: 11.7+/-2.5 s, T2: 10.7+/-4.5 s) and within hypertensive patients. These findings suggest that the dynamics of cerebral autoregulation are well preserved in hypertensive patients, with no difference according to the efficiency of treatment of hypertension.},

abstract = {Hypertension is associated with reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF). Intensive (<130/80 mm Hg) blood pressure (BP) lowering in older people might give greater reduction in cardiovascular risk, but there are concerns that this might produce hypoperfusion which may precipitate falls and possibly stroke. We determined the effect of intensive compared with usual BP lowering on CBF in hypertensive older subjects. Individuals aged >70 years with a history of systolic hypertension on 1 or no BP lowering drugs were recruited from primary care (n=37; age, 75±4 years; systolic BP, >150 mm Hg) and randomized to receive intensive (target BP, <130/80 mm Hg) or usual (target BP, <140/85 mm Hg) BP lowering for 12 weeks, with reviews every 2 weeks. CBF, determined using 3T arterial spin labeling MRI, and 24-hour ambulatory BP were performed at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. Baseline BP (ambulatory or in clinic) and baseline gray matter CBF were not significantly different between the groups. After treatment, BP was reduced significantly in both groups but fell more in the intensive group (26/17 versus 15/5 mm Hg; P<0.01). Over the same period, gray matter CBF increased significantly in the intensive group (7±11 mL/min per 100 g; P=0.013) but was unchanged in the usual BP target group (-3±9 mL/min per 100 g; P=0.23); P<0.01 for comparison. Intensive BP lowering in older people with hypertension increases CBF, compared with BP lowering to usual target. These findings suggest hypertension in older people shifts the autoregulatory CBF curve rightward and downward and is reversible with BP lowering.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of total cerebral blood flow (CBF) with all-cause, noncardiovascular, and cardiovascular mortality in older subjects at risk of cardiovascular disease. METHODS: We included 411 subjects with a mean age of 74.5 years from the MRI substudy of the Prospective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk. Total CBF was measured at baseline, and occurrence of death was recorded in an average follow-up period of 11.8 years. For each participant, total CBF was standardized for brain parenchymal volume. Cox regression models were used to estimate risk of all-cause, noncardiovascular, and cardiovascular mortality in relation to CBF. RESULTS: Mortality rates among participants in low, middle, and high thirds of total CBF were 52.1, 41.5, and 28.7 per 1,000 person-years, respectively. Compared with participants in the high third of CBF, participants in the low third had 1.88-fold (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.30-2.72) higher risk of all-cause mortality, 1.66-fold (95\% CI: 1.06-2.59) higher risk of noncardiovascular mortality, and 2.50-fold (95\% CI: 1.28-4.91) higher risk of cardiovascular mortality. Likewise, compared with participants in the high third of CBF, participants in the middle third had 1.44-fold (95\% CI: 0.98-2.11) higher risk of all-cause mortality, 1.29-fold (95\% CI: 0.82-2.04) higher risk of noncardiovascular mortality, and 1.86-fold (95\% CI: 0.93-3.74) higher risk of cardiovascular mortality. These associations were independent of prevalent vascular status and risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Low total CBF is linked with higher risk of all-cause, noncardiovascular, and cardiovascular mortality in older people independent of clinical cardiovascular status.},

In accordance with this goal, the aim of the present work was to investigate whether altered cerebral microvascular function in patients suffering from type 1 diabetes can be detected with a transcranial Doppler probe after the administration of acetazolamide. A total of 72 type 1 diabetic patients and 40 healthy control subjects entered the study. Patients were divided into two groups: those with long-term diabetes (disease duration of >10 years, n = 37) and those with short-term diabetes (disease duration of < or =10 years, n = 35). Mean blood-flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MCAV) was measured at rest and at 5, 10, 15, and 20 min after intravenous administration of 1 g acetazolamide with a transcranial Doppler probe and expressed as the percentage change from the pretest measurement. The percentage increase in MCAV (cerebrovascular reactivity) was calculated at each time point and compared between the groups. Cerebrovascular reserve capacity (CRC), expressed as the maximal percentage increase of the MCAV, was compared between the groups. Additionally, a reproducibility study of CRC was performed in 10 patients, using intraclass correlations. Cerebrovascular reactivity in the long-term diabetes group was lower (means +/- SD: 5 min, 23.4 +/- 15.4\%; 10 min, 28.8 +/- 17.0\%; 15 min, 30.0 +/- 15.6\%; 20 min, 24.2 +/- 17.8\%) than that of the control subjects (5 min, 43.5 +/- 23.9\%; 10 min, 55.3 +/- 24.0\%; 15 min, 56.7 +/- 23.8\%; 20 min, 54.8 +/- 25.9\%) and the short-term diabetic patients (5 min, 43.6 +/- 25.9\%; 10 min, 52.2 +/- 27.7\%; 15 min, 55.3 +/- 32.2\%; 20 min, 45.8 +/- 35.8\%). CRC was lower in the long-term diabetes group than in the control group or the short-term diabetes group. Impairment of cerebrovascular reactivity was associated with retino- and nephropathy and increased levels of fibrinogen. In contrast, CRC was independent from actual glucose, insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin, von Willebrand factor antigen, and alpha-2 macroglobulin levels. Transcranial Doppler measurements of the changes in MCAV after stimulation with acetazolamide can detect altered cerebral microvascular function in patients with diabetes. Cerebrovascular reactivity and reserve capacity are reduced in patients with long-term diabetes. Further prospective studies should delineate the clinical significance of our results.},

Excess body fat has been linked to impaired glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, and impulsivity and may be a precursor to decline in attention and executive cognitive function.

A total of 16 adult men and 20 adult women were recruited from the community between January 2003 and July 2009 as part of a healthy brain study (HBS) conducted at the Amen Clinics, a private medical facility. Participants in the study were screened to exclude medical, neurological, and psychiatric conditions, including substance abuse. Subjects were categorized as normal or overweight according to BMI. Using a two sample t-test, we determined the effects of BMI on rCBF in normal vs. overweight subjects. Subjects were matched for age and gender. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) revealed a higher BMI in healthy individuals that is associated with decreased rCBF in Broadmann areas 8, 9, 10, 11, 32, and 44, brain regions involved in attention, reasoning, and executive function (P < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons). We found that an elevated BMI is associated with decreased rCBF in the prefrontal cortex of a healthy cohort. These results indicate that elevated BMI may be a risk factor for decreased prefrontal cortex function and potentially impaired executive function.},

abstract = {Quantifying tissue iron concentration in vivo is instrumental for understanding the role of iron in physiology and in neurological diseases associated with abnormal iron distribution. Herein, we use recently-developed Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) methodology to estimate the tissue magnetic susceptibility based on MRI signal phase. To investigate the effect of different regularization choices, we implement and compare ??? 1 and ??? 2 norm regularized QSM algorithms. These regularized approaches solve for the underlying magnetic susceptibility distribution, a sensitive measure of the tissue iron concentration, that gives rise to the observed signal phase. Regularized QSM methodology also involves a pre-processing step that removes, by dipole fitting, unwanted background phase effects due to bulk susceptibility variations between air and tissue and requires data acquisition only at a single field strength. For validation, performances of the two QSM methods were measured against published estimates of regional brain iron from postmortem and in vivo data. The in vivo comparison was based on data previously acquired using Field-Dependent Relaxation Rate Increase (FDRI), an estimate of MRI relaxivity enhancement due to increased main magnetic field strength, requiring data acquired at two different field strengths. The QSM analysis was based on susceptibility-weighted images acquired at 1.5T, whereas FDRI analysis used Multi-Shot Echo-Planar Spin Echo images collected at 1.5T and 3.0T. Both datasets were collected in the same healthy young and elderly adults. The in vivo estimates of regional iron concentration comported well with published postmortem measurements; both QSM approaches yielded the same rank ordering of iron concentration by brain structure, with the lowest in white matter and the highest in globus pallidus. Further validation was provided by comparison of the in vivo measurements, ??? 1-regularized QSM versus FDRI and ??? 2-regularized QSM versus FDRI, which again yielded perfect rank ordering of iron by brain structure. The final means of validation was to assess how well each in vivo method detected known age-related differences in regional iron concentrations measured in the same young and elderly healthy adults. Both QSM methods and FDRI were consistent in identifying higher iron concentrations in striatal and brain stem ROIs (i.e., caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, red nucleus, and substantia nigra) in the older than in the young group. The two QSM methods appeared more sensitive in detecting age differences in brain stem structures as they revealed differences of much higher statistical significance between the young and elderly groups than did FDRI. However, QSM values are influenced by factors such as the myelin content, whereas FDRI is a more specific indicator of iron content. Hence, FDRI demonstrated higher specificity to iron yet yielded noisier data despite longer scan times and lower spatial resolution than QSM. The robustness, practicality, and demonstrated ability of predicting the change in iron deposition in adult aging suggest that regularized QSM algorithms using single-field-strength data are possible alternatives to tissue iron estimation requiring two field strengths. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To perform systematic investigations on parameter selection of a dual-echo sequence (ToF-SWI) for combined 3D time-of-flight (ToF) angiography and susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: ToF-SWI was implemented on 1.5 T and 3 T MR scanners with complete 3D first-order flow compensation of the second echo. The efficiency of flow compensating the SWI echo was studied based on phantom and in vivo examinations. Arterial and venous contrasts were examined in volunteers as a function of flip angle and compared with additionally acquired single-echo ToF and single-echo SWI data. RESULTS: Complete flow compensation is required to reduce arterial contamination in the SWI part caused by signal voids. A ramped flip angle of 20 degrees depicted arteries best while venous contrast was preserved. Comparing ToF-SWI with single-echo ToF demonstrated arteries with similar quality and delineated all major arteries equally well. Venous delineation was degraded due to lower SNR associated with the thinner slabs used with ToF-SWI compared to single-echo SWI acquisition. CONCLUSION: A dual-echo sequence (ToF-SWI) with full flow compensation of the second echo in a single scan is feasible. This sequence allows simultaneous visualization of intrinsically coregistered arteries and veins without spatial mis-registration of vessels caused by oblique flow and with minimal signal loss in arteries.},

Recently, targeting contrast agents by conjugation with signaling molecules and labeling stem cells with contrast agents have become feasible. These contrast agents are strongly paramagnetic, and the ability to quantify magnetic susceptibility could allow accurate measurement of signaling and cell localization. Presented here is a technique to estimate arbitrary magnetic susceptibility distributions by solving an ill-posed inversion problem from field maps obtained in an MRI scanner. Two regularization strategies are considered: conventional Tikhonov regularization and a sparsity promoting nonlinear regularization using the l(1) norm. Proof of concept is demonstrated using numerical simulations, phantoms, and in a stroke model in a rat. Initial experience indicates that the nonlinear regularization better suppresses noise and streaking artifacts common in susceptibility estimation.},

abstract = {A method is presented for the combination of phase images from multi-channel RF coils in the absence of a volume reference coil. It is based on the subtraction of 3D phase offset maps from the phase data from each coil. Phase offset maps are weighted combinations of phase measurements at two echo times. Multi-Channel Phase Combination using measured 3D phase offsets (MCPC-3D) offers a conceptually and computationally simple solution to the calculation of combined phase images. The dual-echo data required for the phase maps can be intrinsic to the high-resolution gradient-echo scan to be reconstructed (MCPC-3D-I). Alternatively, a separate, fast, low-resolution dual-echo scan can be used (MCPC-3D-II). Both variants are shown to give near perfect phase matching, yielding images with high SNR throughout and high GM-WM contrast. MCPC-3D is compared with other reference-free phase image combination methods; high-pass phase filtering, phase difference imaging, and matching using constant offsets (MCPC-C). Multi-Channel Phase Combination using measured 3D phase offsets method does not need an overlap between the signals from individual coils and can be used with parallel imaging, making it ideally suited to multi-channel coils with a large number of elements, and to high and ultra-high field systems.},

This study introduces a framework for QSM and demonstrates calculation of reproducible and orientation-independent susceptibility maps from GRE data acquired at 3T. The potential of these susceptibility maps to perform anatomical imaging is investigated, as well as the ability to measure the venous blood oxygen saturation level in large vessels, and to assess the local tissue iron concentration. In order to take into account diamagnetic susceptibility contributions induced by myelin, a correction scheme for susceptibility based iron estimation is demonstrated. The findings suggest that susceptibility contrast, and therewith also phase contrast, are not only linked to the storage iron concentration but are also significantly influenced by other sources such as myelin. After myelin correction the linear dependence between magnetic susceptibilities and previously published iron concentrations from post mortem studies was significantly improved. Finally, a comparison between susceptibility maps and processed phase images indicated that caution should be exercised when drawing conclusions about iron concentrations when directly assessing processed phase information. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Schenck1996,
abstract = {The concept of magnetic susceptibility is central to many current research and development activities in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); for example, the development of MR-guided surgery has created a need for surgical instruments and other devices with susceptibility tailored to the MR environment; susceptibility effects can lead to position errors of up to several millimeters in MR-guided stereotactic surgery; and the variation of magnetic susceptibility on a microscopic scale within tissues contributes to MR contrast and is the basis of functional MRI. The magnetic aspects of MR compatibility are discussed in terms of two levels of acceptability: Materials with the first kind of magnetic field compatibility are such that magnetic forces and torques do not interfere significantly when the materials are used within the magnetic field of the scanner; materials with the second kind of magnetic field compatibility meet the more demanding requirement that they produce only negligible artifacts within the MR image and their effect on the positional accuracy of features within the image is negligible or can readily be corrected. Several materials exhibiting magnetic field compatibility of the second kind have been studied and a group of materials that produce essentially no image distortion, even when located directly within the imaging field of view, is identified. Because of demagnetizing effects, the shape and orientation, as well as the susceptibility, of objects within and adjacent to the imaging region is important in MRI. The quantitative use of susceptibility data is important to MRI, but the use of literature values for the susceptibility of materials is often difficult because of inconsistent traditions in the definitions and units used for magnetic parameters-particularly susceptibility. The uniform use of SI units for magnetic susceptibility and related quantities would help to achieve consistency and avoid confusion in MRI.},

@article{Duyn2007,
abstract = {The ability to detect brain anatomy and pathophysiology with MRI is limited by the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), which depends on the contrast mechanism used and the spatial resolution. In this work, we show that in MRI of the human brain, large improvements in contrast to noise in high-resolution images are possible by exploiting the MRI signal phase at high magnetic field strength. Using gradient-echo MRI at 7.0 tesla and a multichannel detector, a nominal voxel size of 0.24 x 0.24 x 1.0 mm3 (58 nl) was achieved. At this resolution, a strong phase contrast was observed both between as well as within gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM). In gradient-echo phase images obtained on normal volunteers at this high resolution, the CNR between GM and WM ranged from 3:1 to 20:1 over the cortex. This CNR is an almost 10-fold improvement over conventional MRI techniques that do not use image phase, and it is an approximately 100-fold improvement when including the gains in resolution from high-field and multichannel detection. Within WM, phase contrast appeared to be associated with the major fiber bundles, whereas contrast within GM was suggestive of the underlying layer structure. The observed phase contrast is attributed to local variations in magnetic susceptibility, which, at least in part, appeared to originate from iron stores. The ability to detect cortical substructure from MRI phase contrast at high field is expected to greatly enhance the study of human brain anatomy in vivo.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Fourier transform-based field estimation method is used to calculate the field deviation arising from air-tissue interface geometry. This is accomplished by manually drawing or automatically detecting the sinuses, the mastoid cavity, and the head geometry. The difference in susceptibility, Deltachi, between brain tissue and air spaces is then calculated using a residual-phase minimization approach. SWI data are corrected by subtracting the predicted phase from the original phase images. Resultant phase images are then used to perform the SWI postprocessing. RESULTS: Significant improvement in the postprocessed SWI data is demonstrated, most notably in the frontal and midbrain regions and to a lesser extent at the boundary of the brain. Specifically, there is much less dropout of signal after phase correction near air-tissue interfaces, making it possible to see vessels and structures that were often incorrectly removed by the conventional SWI postprocessing. CONCLUSION: The Fourier transform-based field estimation method is a powerful 3D background phase removal method for improving SWI images, providing clearer images of the forebrain and the midbrain regions.},

In this article, we report an observation that the magnetic field for a dipole outside a given region of interest (ROI) is approximately orthogonal to the magnetic field of a dipole inside the ROI. Accordingly, we propose a nonparametric background field removal technique based on projection onto dipole fields (PDF). In this PDF technique, the background field inside an ROI is decomposed into a field originating from dipoles outside the ROI using the projection theorem in Hilbert space. This novel PDF background removal technique was validated on a numerical simulation and a phantom experiment and was applied in human brain imaging, demonstrating substantial improvement in background field removal compared with the commonly used high-pass filtering method.},

RESHARP was compared with SHARP in a field-forward susceptibility simulation and in human brain experiments, considering effects on both field maps and the resulting susceptibility maps. RESULTS: From the simulation, RESHARP was able to reduce error in the field map by 17.4\% as compared with SHARP, resulting in a more accurate single-angle susceptibility map with 6.5\% relative error (compared with 48.5\% using SHARP). Using RESHARP in vivo, field and susceptibility maps of the brain displayed fewer artifacts particularly at the brain boundaries, and susceptibility measurements of iron-rich deep gray matter were also more consistent than SHARP across healthy subjects of similar age. CONCLUSION: Compared with SHARP, RESHARP removes background field artifact more effectively, leading to more accurate susceptibility measurements in iron-rich deep gray matter.

abstract = {The derivation of susceptibility from image phase is hampered by the ill-conditioned filter inversion in certain k-space regions. In this article, compressed sensing is used to compensate for the k-space regions where direct filter inversion is unstable. A significantly lower level of streaking artifacts is produced in the resulting susceptibility maps for both simulated and in vivo data sets compared to outcomes obtained using the direct threshold method. It is also demonstrated that the compressed sensing based method outperforms regularization based methods. The key difference between the regularized inversions and compressed sensing compensated inversions is that, in the former case, the entire k-space spectrum estimation is affected by the ill-conditioned filter inversion in certain k-space regions, whereas in the compressed sensing based method only the ill-conditioned k-space regions are estimated. In the susceptibility map calculated from the phase measurement obtained using a 3T scanner, not only are the iron-rich regions well depicted, but good contrast between white and gray matter interfaces that feature a low level of susceptibility variations are also obtained. The correlation between the iron content and the susceptibility levels in iron-rich deep nucleus regions is studied, and strong linear relationships are observed which agree with previous findings.

abstract = {Image phase from gradient echo MRI provides a unique contrast that reflects brain tissue composition variations, such as iron and myelin distribution. Phase imaging is emerging as a powerful tool for the investigation of functional brain anatomy and disease diagnosis. However, the quantitative value of phase is compromised by its nonlocal and orientation dependent properties. There is an increasing need for reliable quantification of magnetic susceptibility, the intrinsic property of tissue. In this study, we developed a novel and accurate susceptibility mapping method that is also phase-wrap insensitive. The proposed susceptibility mapping method utilized two complementary equations: (1) the Fourier relationship of phase and magnetic susceptibility; and (2) the first-order partial derivative of the first equation in the spatial frequency domain. In numerical simulation, this method reconstructed the susceptibility map almost free of streaking artifact. Further, the iterative implementation of this method allowed for high quality reconstruction of susceptibility maps of human brain in vivo. The reconstructed susceptibility map provided excellent contrast of iron-rich deep nuclei and white matter bundles from surrounding tissues. Further, it also revealed anisotropic magnetic susceptibility in brain white matter. Hence, the proposed susceptibility mapping method may provide a powerful tool for the study of brain physiology and pathophysiology. Further elucidation of anisotropic magnetic susceptibility in vivo may allow us to gain more insight into the white matter micro-architectures. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

However, the determination of an arbitrary susceptibility distribution from the measured MR signal phase is a challenging, ill-conditioned inverse problem. Although a previous method named calculation of susceptibility through multiple orientation sampling (COSMOS) has solved this inverse problem both theoretically and experimentally using multiple angle acquisitions, it is often impractical to carry out on human subjects. Recently, the feasibility of calculating the brain susceptibility distribution from a single-angle acquisition was demonstrated using morphology enabled dipole inversion (MEDI). In this study, we further improved the original MEDI method by sparsifying the edges in the quantitative susceptibility map that do not have a corresponding edge in the magnitude image. Quantitative susceptibility maps generated by the improved MEDI were compared qualitatively and quantitatively with those generated by calculation of susceptibility through multiple orientation sampling. The results show a high degree of agreement between MEDI and calculation of susceptibility through multiple orientation sampling, and the practicality of MEDI allows many potential clinical applications.

Susceptibility weighted imaging, QSM, and R2* maps were reconstructed from in vivo data acquired with a 3-dimensional, multi-echo, and T2*-weighted gradient echo sequence. Magnetic susceptibility measurements were correlated to susceptibility weighted imaging and R2* results. In addition, iron concentrations from surgically excised CCM lesion specimens were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and correlated with QSM measurements.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The QSM images demonstrated excellent image quality for depicting CCM lesions in both sporadic and familial cases. Susceptibility measurements revealed a positive linear correlation with R2* values (R = 0.99 for total, R = 0.69 for mean; P < 0.01). Quantitative susceptibility mapping values of known iron-rich brain regions matched closely with those of previous studies and in interobserver consistency. A strong correlation was found between QSM and the concentration of iron phantoms (0.925; P < 0.01), as well as between QSM and mass spectroscopy estimation of iron deposition (0.999 for total iron, 0.86 for iron concentration; P < 0.01) in 18 fragments of 4 excised human CCM lesion specimens.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The ability of QSM to evaluate iron deposition in CCM lesions was illustrated via phantom, in vivo, and ex vivo validation studies.

Each new terminal segment is connected to the optimum site within the preexisting tree, and the new bifurcation is optimized geometrically. After each step of adding and optimizing, the whole tree is rescaled to meet invariant boundary conditions of pressure and flow at each terminal site. Thus, local geometric optimization is used to induce simultaneously an optimized global structure.

abstract = {This paper presents a method for the coregistration and partitioning (i.e., tissue segmentation) of brain images that have been acquired in different modalities. The basic idea is that instead of matching two images directly, one performs intermediate within-modality registrations to two template images that are already in register. One can use a least-squares minimization to determine the affine transformations that map between the templates and the images. By incorporating suitable constraints, a rigid body transformation which directly maps between the images can be extracted from these more general affine transformations. A further refinement capitalizes on the implicit normalization of both images into a standard space. This facilitates segmentation or partitioning of both original images into homologous tissue classifications. Once partitioned, the partitions can be jointly matched, further increasing the accuracy of the coregistration. In short, these techniques reduce the between-modality problem to a series of simpler within-modality problems. These methods are relatively robust, address a number of problems in image transformations, and require no manual intervention.},

@misc{Mechelli2005,
abstract = {In recent years, a whole-brain unbiased objective technique, known as voxel-based morphometry (VBM), has been developed to characterise brain differences in vivo using structural magnetic resonance images. The present review provides a brief description of VBM and then focuses on exemplar applications in healthy and diseased subjects. The procedure involves normalising high-resolution structural magnetic resonance images to a standard template in stereotactic space. Normalised images are then segmented into gray and white matter and smoothed using an isotropic Gaussian kernel. Finally, a series of voxel-wise comparisons of gray and white matter in different groups of subjects are performed, using Random Field theory to correct for multiple comparisons. VBM has been useful in characterizing subtle changes in brain structure in a variety of diseases associated with neurological and psychiatric dysfunction. These include schizophrenia, developmental and congenital disorders, temporal lobe epilepsy and even cluster headache. In addition, VBM has been successful in identifying gross structural abnormalities, such as those observed in herpes simplex encephalitis, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease. Studies of normal subjects, on the other hand, have focussed on the impact of learning and practice on brain structure. These studies have led to the finding that environmental demands may be associated with changes in gray and white matter. For instance, it has been reported that the structure of the brain alters when human beings learn to navigate, read music, speak a second language and even perform a complex motor task such as juggling. We conclude the present review by discussing the potential limitations of the technique.},

abstract = {Modern neurosurgical concepts call for not only "seeing" but also for "localizing" structures in three-dimensional space in relationship to each other. Hence there is a need for a reference system. This book aims to put this notion into practice by means of anatomical and MRI sections with the same stereotaxic orientation. The purpose is to display the fundamental distribution of structures in three-dimensional space and their spatial evolution within the brain as a whole, while facilitating their identification; to make comparative studies of cortico-subcortical lesions possible on a basis of an equivalent reference system; to exploit the anatomo-functional data such as those furnished by SEEG in epilepsy and to enable the localization of special regions such as the SMA in three-dimensional space; and to apply the anatomical correlations of this reference system to neurophysiological investigations lacking sufficient anatomical back-up (including PET scan).},

abstract = {Spatial normalization is the procedure of wrapping images from a number of individuals into roughly the same standard space to allow signal averaging across subjects. This chapter discusses the steps involved in registering images of different subjects into the same coordinate system. It involves determining the optimum 12-parameter affine transformation. The next is nonlinear registration for correcting gross differences in head shapes that cannot be accounted for by the affine normalization alone. A fast algorithm is described that utilizes Taylor's theorem. Most of the nonlinear spatial variability between images can be automatically corrected within minutes. The last part describes a variety of possible models for intensity transforms. In addition to spatial transformations, it is sometimes desirable to include intensity transforms in the registration model, because one image may not look exactly like a spatially transformed version of the other. The registration scheme described in this chapter is constrained to describe warps with a few hundred parameters. Knowledge of major white matter tracts should provide structural information more directly related to connectivity and implicit function, possibly leading to improved registration of functionally specialized areas. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {This paper describes DARTEL, which is an algorithm for diffeomorphic image registration. It is implemented for both 2D and 3D image registration and has been formulated to include an option for estimating inverse consistent deformations. Nonlinear registration is considered as a local optimisation problem, which is solved using a Levenberg-Marquardt strategy. The necessary matrix solutions are obtained in reasonable time using a multigrid method. A constant Eulerian velocity framework is used, which allows a rapid scaling and squaring method to be used in the computations. DARTEL has been applied to intersubject registration of 471 whole brain images, and the resulting deformations were evaluated in terms of how well they encode the shape information necessary to separate male and female subjects and to predict the ages of the subjects. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {All fields of neuroscience that employ brain imaging need to communicate their results with reference to anatomical regions. In particular, comparative morphometry and group analysis of functional and physiological data require coregistration of brains to establish correspondences across brain structures. It is well established that linear registration of one brain to another is inadequate for aligning brain structures, so numerous algorithms have emerged to nonlinearly register brains to one another. This study is the largest evaluation of nonlinear deformation algorithms applied to brain image registration ever conducted. Fourteen algorithms from laboratories around the world are evaluated using 8 different error measures. More than 45,000 registrations between 80 manually labeled brains were performed by algorithms including: AIR, ANIMAL, ART, Diffeomorphic Demons, FNIRT, IRTK, JRD-fluid, ROMEO, SICLE, SyN, and four different SPM5 algorithms ("SPM2-type" and regular Normalization, Unified Segmentation, and the DARTEL Toolbox). All of these registrations were preceded by linear registration between the same image pairs using FLIRT. One of the most significant findings of this study is that the relative performances of the registration methods under comparison appear to be little affected by the choice of subject population, labeling protocol, and type of overlap measure. This is important because it suggests that the findings are generalizable to new subject populations that are labeled or evaluated using different labeling protocols. Furthermore, we ranked the 14 methods according to three completely independent analyses (permutation tests, one-way ANOVA tests, and indifference-zone ranking) and derived three almost identical top rankings of the methods. ART, SyN, IRTK, and SPM's DARTEL Toolbox gave the best results according to overlap and distance measures, with ART and SyN delivering the most consistently high accuracy across subjects and label sets.

Maximum intensity projection images and subtracted source images were compared with those obtained by conventional angiography. In all cases, the presence or absence of abnormalities in the targeted vessels, as well as the morphology of the sagittal sinuses, was clearly visualized as in conventional angiography, without any obstructions such as hyperintense hematomas or thrombi, or intraluminal turbulence. Although the temporal and spatial resolutions with current hardware are insufficient, these preliminary results suggest that dynamic contrast-enhanced MRA with subtraction may be useful for assessing vascular lesions with hemorrhage or thrombus, and the dural sinuses.},

abstract = {NCE MRA can provide the authors with useful diagnostic information in patients suffering from intracranial vascular disease, often leading to improved or altered treatment decisions. Most centers have used 3D TOF for evaluation of stroke-the most common cerebral vascular disease. Because of slow and disturbed flow, conventional 3D TOF MRA tends to overestimate stenotic lesions and occluded arteries and this can confound neurovascular assessment in stroke patients. Post contrast 3D TOF techniques provide a more robust and more specific method for imaging the intracranial circulation that overcomes the drawbacks of conventional 3D TOF. In the setting of acute ischemic stroke, the authors have found that the combination of conventional and CE 3D TOF MRA improves their overall diagnostic ability. Dynamic and time-resolved CE MRA techniques have evolved rapidly. Time-resolved CE MRA, in particular, is emerging as a useful technique for imaging dynamic vascular pathologies such as AVMs. Unfortunately. time-resolved MRA of the intracranial circulation provides images with low spatial resolution and is currently limited to subsecond frame rate 2D acquisitions, and less than 2 seconds Frame rates for 3D acquisitions. Nevertheless, like in other vascular regions, CE MRA represents a milestone for non-invasive intracranial vascular imaging. The continuing development of CE MRA techniques and of new contrast agents will lessen the need for intra-arterial angiography in the future.},

The increased random motion of the protons causes loss of intensity on the first-echo image, although rephasing with increased intensity can be noted on the second-echo image.

abstract = {Characterization of the complex branching architecture of cerebral arteries across a representative sample of the human population is important for diagnosing, analyzing, and predicting pathological states. Brain arterial vasculature can be visualized by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). However, most MRA studies are limited to qualitative assessments, partial morphometric analyses, individual (or small numbers of) subjects, proprietary datasets, or combinations of the above limitations. Neuroinformatics tools, developed for neuronal arbor analysis, were used to quantify vascular morphology from 3. T time-of-flight MRA high-resolution (620. ??m isotropic) images collected in 61 healthy volunteers (36/25 F/M, average age. =. 31.2. ??. 10.7, range. =. 19-64. years). We present in-depth morphometric analyses of the global and local anatomical features of these arbors. The overall structure and size of the vasculature did not significantly differ across genders, ages, or hemispheres. The total length of the three major arterial trees stemming from the circle of Willis (from smallest to largest: the posterior, anterior, and middle cerebral arteries; or PCAs, ACAs, and MCAs, respectively) followed an approximate 1:2:4 proportion. Arterial size co-varied across individuals: subjects with one artery longer than average tended to have all other arteries also longer than average. There was no net right-left difference across the population in any of the individual arteries, but ACAs were more lateralized than MCAs. MCAs, ACAs, and PCAs had similar branch-level properties such as bifurcation angles. Throughout the arterial vasculature, there were considerable differences between branch types: bifurcating branches were significantly shorter and straighter than terminating branches. Furthermore, the length and meandering of bifurcating branches increased with age and with path distance from the circle of Willis. All reconstructions are freely distributed through a public database to enable additional analyses and modeling (cng.gmu.edu/brava). ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},
